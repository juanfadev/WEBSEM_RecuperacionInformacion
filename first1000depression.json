Should I even bring it up?\n\n I found out yesterday that my little brother (15) while on his way to school, went to our old home and tried to kill himself. \nHe failed, thank God, and went to school as normal. We found out about it once a counselor called him in simce he had to turn something in. That's when he told her. She then called our parents and told them.\n\nHes been in a hospital or psychiatric ward, one of those, since yesterday and is being released today as they say he needs a therapist. They told us he since calmed down. How do I act? Do i even bring it up? \nSome key points. He doesnt want me or my youngest brother to know about this. Even told my parents that went to visit him to tell us he went camping. Obviously I know but my youngest brother doesnt. I found 2 journals in his bag that both contained goodbye letters to us dated 04/01/19 and another around 01/16/19. The journals also have entries dating back as 07/12/18. Do i ask him about them?\n\nI need any help i can gather. I'll expand on anything else that may help. I dont want to lose him. Thank you un advance.",

I still have some bad days with my depression where I don't have much motivation, but I feel like it isn't too bad atm. I went to the doctors yesterday about my anxiety and he wasn't much help... He suggested taking sertraline, which is an SSRI, and gave me a prescription for that. However, I don't want to take antidepressants again as I don't want to rely on them and take them everyday. I just wanted something that would help with my anxiety as I have looked up these tablets and they don't say anything about taking them for anxiety disorders. I have also referred myself to get some therapy or help to deal with my anxiety.\n\nI'm just a bit stuck in what to do at the moment. I have booked another doctors appointment for next week, but I don't want this to go on much longer as I have finals soon and don't want to be stressed about finding the right medication etc.\n\nI'm just a bit lost in what to do so any advice or guidance will help!",

I have all these things racing through my head and when I go to write them down it sounds like nonsense (like this post). I struggling and I feel like no one notices or cares. Social life is dead, friendships have dissolved, and even the girlfriend and I decided we would be better breaking it off, which is awesome when you have a lease together.\n\nI want to scream and cry but then would feel guilty because i didn\u2019t accomplish anything. Really wish my brain had a recent button like a computer because I am not well.\n\nI always give in to the stigma that telling people this makes me weak, but I don\u2019t feel that way about others, only me. I\u2019m bored with everything but i can\u2019t get myself motivated to do anything. They\u2019ll say \u201cjust try it\u201d but don\u2019t realize i physically and mentally CAN\u2019T.

About a week ago, I met up with my ex whom I broke up with due to my depression to catch up. I don\u2019t know why but ever since this event I can feel myself spiraling again and giving in to my old negative feelings. My birthday was also two days ago, and I saw a video of myself and I just gained so much weight. It\u2019s kind of destroyed my self confidence all over again. \n\nMy family has been so happy that I don\u2019t want to kill myself upon waking up anymore. I don\u2019t really have any close friends that I can confide in. When I tell my siblings I feel like they don\u2019t know how to respond or help me, and I don\u2019t want to put that on them. I\u2019m scared to tell my parents because they\u2019ve already been through so much hearing their youngest girl tell them she wishes she was never born.  I just need to tell someone. Maybe just this will be enough.\n\nCould it be hormones due to my shark week? God I hope so.",

            "selftext": "A little context:\n\nSince I was a young teenager, I often wondered why some people would cut themselves. I used to believe that people did it because it was a pain that they had a sense of control over. It just didn\u2019t make sense to me though. Once cut, you can\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d to feel or not feel the physical pain it causes, right?\n\nNow, this may actually be the case for some people. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not here to make some generalization about people who cut themselves. Nor am I making some psychological claim backed up by scientific data. I\u2019m here solely to share a new perspective I have for inflicting pain on oneself.\n\nI have been dealing with clinical depression for a little while now. Despite a clear family history of mental illness, I spent a long time denying that such a thing could happen to me. It wasn\u2019t until a failed attempt to commit suicide, and seeing the pain that it caused my family, to finally admit that I might need some help.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years now of therapy and medication, and although I\u2019ve made progress, I still experience many setbacks...I\u2019m going through an exceptionally difficult one right now.\n\nI was sitting in my bedroom one day, frustrated as fuck with myself, and for some reason started punching my legs. I\u2019m sure I must\u2019ve looked like a child throwing a tantrum, but it seemed like the energy released, coupled with the physical pain, was enough to distract me from the disappointment and anger of not being good enough that was eating me up inside.\n\nIn retrospect, I feel bad about that moment, because my dog was in the room with me, and with every blow to my thighs, she would get scared and move farther away. I now know better and keep her outside my bedroom when hurting myself. \n\nSo, punching seemed to help, but it wasn\u2019t quite enough. I soon moved to whipping myself in the back, over the shoulder, with one of my leather belts. This proved much more effective. I was surprised the first time I tried this method of self-harm. The delayed, hot sting, immediately took me back to my childhood when my dad would hit me with a leather strap. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve received that particular form of punishment, but I instantly recognized that sensation.\n\nI have since been able to continue with this practice without being burdened by thoughts of the past. It\u2019s all about helping me cope with the present. I never considered that inflicting pain on oneself could have nothing to do with control, but serve merely as a means of distraction. I actually look forward to coming home and whipping myself, and will get annoyed if someone or something keeps me from it. Sure, it hurts like hell, but I feel better emotionally afterwards.\n\nNow, I\u2019m sure this is not the healthiest type of behavior, and I should probably talk to my therapist about it, but I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll try to make me stop. I don\u2019t plan on doing this forever...just until a get over this little slump I\u2019m in.\n\nAnyways...it feels good to talk about this without having to look someone in the eyes afterwards and promise never to do it again.",

I\u2019m struggling with depression since 2013 and i can\u2019t control my mood in noway. I\u2019m a good looking guy who train every day, never skip a session and really good at university, this 2 things are my \u201cgoing on\u201d, but when i think about my relation with other people i\u2019m really bad. I talk only with my family and 2 university collegues, i broked up with my ex 1 year ago and i hate almost people because i think that i envy them, they look so happy... i think to commite suicide al least 3xyear, above all when the external world hit me, like when i got a crush and she says no or someone criticizes me. I\u2019m really weak and that causes my depression, i\u2019m on therapy but when it seems that all is going up, there\u2019s an event that brings me in the deep of my sadness. Maybe I\u2019m not really done for this world.",

I do apologize for the word vomit but perhaps it will help me focus on something. I don't know.  \n\nI am having such a hard time operating at work. I move in bursts sometimes managing to be productive and then sitting for hours doing nothing. Talking to my peers can be stressful. I keep forgetting to take my meds and I hate myself for the lack of productivity and I worry that I am actually just bothering everyone with my presence. I need this job for money. I like this job okay when I am not sitting spinning my wheels. I am having an incredibility hard time thinking of what needs to be done and then moving forward to accomplish it. I am lucky my workplace is kind and lax but I wish I was better. I wish I could talk to people and not worry I am talking too much. However, I also know that if I don't talk I can seem scary. I don't want to be scary either. I just feel so disorganized right now and I wish I was better than I am. I am proud of so much in my life but I always feel like I am not good enough.

            "selftext": "This wasn't always the case. The first 2 months were nothing but love and happiness. We would see each other 2-3 days a week due to distance but enjoyed every second of it. Then about 10 days ago her depression kicked in for the first time in our relationship.     \n\n\n\nIt started with her getting annoyed by my humor. She wasn't sure if I was annoying or if she was just irritable. She looked at her phone and said it was her since her period was coming up. Of course, I know just how annoying I can be so I turned my personality down like 3 notches for the week.     \n\n\n\nThen things got suspiciously bad. She came over and for the first time ever she did not want to cuddle or talk at all. She fell asleep on the opposite side of the bed and clearly didn't want any physical contact. This was a complete 180 for her since she normally is freezing without me. I had to leave early in the morning for work before she woke up. I come back and learned she left to see a movie by herself 30 minutes before I got home from work. When she came back from the movie she stayed for half an hour then drove home.     \n\n\n\nWe had a talk about it and after some gentle prying she told me \"I couldn't stand the affection anymore, not one more night.\" We talked some more and she went into detail about her depression, medication, and just about everything. From what I can tell the medication she is on is both the wrong medication for her and even the wrong dose. She agrees on the wrong medication aspect and was neglecting to switch it due to denial (until now). We haven't seen each other since the day she left but continue to talk every day, albeit less.       \n\n\n\nDespite our progress, she still heavily dislikes a lot of my enthusiastic personality. I know you can't solve depression but I do want to solve some of the dynamics of our relationship. so below are the problems I want to address and I'm open to any advice.     \n\n* How do I show support in a semi-long distance relationship (100 miles)?\n* Is it normal to be annoyed by your SO when depressed?\n* How do I reduce/recover my feelings of being emotionally drained?",

She blew up my mind and I has become crazy. In the begining everything was fine, we was friends and etc. at one moment I suggested she be my girlfriend. She refused. But I was really crazy, I couldn't stop thinking about her, and I saw her every day, we are studing at the same university. I couldn't stop bother her and she got very angry. We didn't talk about 2-3 month, and all this i was in a great depression. \n\nAfter this time i found out that she found a boyfriend, It was my friend, with whom I discussed this problem a lot. Of corse it was not easy, but I resigned. I found a girl, everything was Ok\n\nFinally, let's get down to my problem, last 2 month I have something like depression, every day i think that i choose the wrong university, i have problem with my health, i dont know about what talk with my present girlfrind, nothing fascinates me, any failure makes me angry and I just want to die and i think that everything in my life is going to shit. And the main reason of my depression, it is DF,  becouse all my life revolves around her. We are friends now, we have the same hobbies, read the same books, watching the same films. But now, I am thinking about her everyday again. I dont know what to do, I can not accept the fact that I can never be with her. \n\nSorry about long post, and I rely on your understanding.  Maybe I did not write something, I will add it later",

I came here to meet my girlfriend which I haven't seen for 4 months straight and really missed for the whole time and when I met her I had to realize that she doesn't gibe a shit about me anymore and just makes fun of how negative and depressed I am which was really painful for me. I actually started seeing good things in myself but she just really destroyed all of that somehow bc she once saw so many good things in me and now I'm just a joke to her apparently...like my whole existance is just a total joke to her....\nSo we split up and now I'm travelling alone which is kind of better than having her around me but I'm still totally fucked up and anxious. Also I'm running out of money very quickly and I don't want to ask my parents for money anymore I've been more than enough of a burden and I don't want all of this. I came here to have a good time but now I realized that it was a big mistake doing all of this. Especially with her.\nI don't know what to do I feel more lost than ever and also I'm really afraid to fall into psychosis again. \nI don't know where else to go so I just write this here\nI hope that I've not been too much trouble and that my text wasn't too long to read.",

I barely even use it but today's my birthday and I feel this crushing loneliness and I've been crying since the morning. I basically have no plans with anyone. It is my fault. I alienated most people I knew because i constantly felt like a 2nd tier friend (i am not sure if this was even true or not). I am so close to just getting on tinder and matching with some guy and getting drunk and getting sad dick but I'm afraid I might start crying in the middle. I have been feeling like I will always be lonely and I am not good enough to be worth anything to anyone and I feel hopeless about the future. How do I cope with these feelings? I am trying to rationalize but I can't stop myself from feeling this way.",

(sometimes I think I see things how I want, not how they are) Or maybe I was forcing it to be. We had a huge fight and he said some hurtful things and ever since then I don't see him the same. I look at him and I feel anger, not adoration like before. I've been getting angry easier and it makes me want to scream and try to get him to realize how he is making me feel. The heavy toll of the stress from trying to get some form of caring from him is weighing on me hard. I've been unable to speak for the most part, as if I actually can't find words or maybe I just gave up because I can't even think of a thing to say. When I can, it seems so unimportant I just keep it to myself. All I've been wanting to do is lay in bed and stare at the wall. Somehow, I don't even feel bored. I have been focusing on how I feel so much that I can't focus on anything else. I don't know if he doesn't know what is going on or simply doesn't care enough to get involved. He just sits on the couch and watches sports. He puts that above me. I could be right next to him crying and he won't say a word to me or show that he even notices. It is so true when people say they feel more alone being around someone than if they were by themselves. That's where I am at. I used to self-harm as a kid and prided myself in not doing it for years but every once in a while it is almost as if I can't help it. I don't know if I like the distraction or I am acting out for attention so he can see what is going on, hoping he will care. Maybe both. Does this make me a bad person? Am I over-exaggerating? I just can't stand being with someone and feeling as if they couldn't care less and acts selfish in a sense. I do nothing but put him first every time and everyday. If I get mad and tell him how I feel he gets mad right back. If I am quiet and don't say anything, he won't bring it up or try to help. It feels like a constant losing battle. I am scare if I tell him what really is on my mind, he will decide he can't handle me and leave. I recently have been day-dreaming of suicide. Not that I will do it or anything I am sure, but it seems like an attractive idea. I space out a lot. I'm dead tired, mostly emotionally. Some people stop feeling altogether and I wish for the same. I tell myself I don't care and I try not to but to no avail. So I guess I am wondering, is it my fault I feel like this? Am I justified in feeling this way? And if I am, am I just being dramatic? I suppose it is worth noting I had been somewhat recently diagnosed with BPD/Bipolar so maybe it is my fault. I don't want to ruin another relationship.. but again, is it me or him?",

            "selftext": "I am 38, I am morbidly obese and struggle with it my entire life.  today for example I had one piece of pork chop and a half a cup of rice and a half a cup of peas for breakfast it was all I had to eat in the house. it was my left over dinner from last night. my cousin can literally eat an entire large 8 slice pizza in one sitting then 5 hours later go back in the kitchen eat 4 hot dogs on bread with mayo and cheese and still not gain weight, sleeps 12 hours a day plays video games the other 12. I on the other hand basically starves myself and eats very little and works out an hour in the morning, an hour in the evening and counts my cals in and cals out. and drinks water. his cal intake is way over 3000 and hes 35 yrs old and only a 180 lbs and never gains. when we have hamburgers for dinner once per month he eats 6 of them with everything on it and the buns. me, I eat just the patty and only two. I basically torture myself with not being able to eat good food because it seems everything I eat just goes right to my stomach, thighs, legs, butt, arms, face. \n\nI have been around 400 lbs my entire life and struggled with it my entire life since I was a kid and have always been active. played sports, etc was homeless for many years still couldn't lose weight. past eight years I decided to put myself out there in the dating scene figured why not. fuck it. I got over all my insecurities, learned to accept my body and weight, learned to love who I was and accept myself for me. was not an easy road considering my entire family told me I was a horrible person, I was ugly, I was disgusting, I was trashy etc. \n\nWell in the dating scene all I got was rejected, told the same things my own family told me, I was ugly, trashy, disgusting, worthless, useless, had nothing to offer, no woman would want me, I am nothing but filth, I should be ashamed of myself for being so fat, I am worse than a drug addict for being so fat, How could I get so fat. Mocked at, laughed at, made fun of even told to end my own life. \n\nPast eight years I have had women tell me I sound like a great guy, a decent guy, a wonderful guy, I would make a great boyfriend, a wonderful husband, a wonderful dad, any woman would be lucky to have a man like me, but as soon as they see a pic of me and see my weight their entire tone changes and I am a horrible person and I don't deserve anything and I am disgusting and filthy etc etc etc. \n\nI can't take living in this world anymore being unloved, unwanted, not needed, undesired, uncared for. I can't do it anymore. I been alone my entire life from the age of 5, I literally can't do it anymore. just going out in public seeing couples together, it kills me inside and my heart drops to my feet because its all I want is someone to get close to, to share my life with to build a life with. When I hear women talk about how their recent ex left them or cheated on them or dumped them or used to beat them, it breaks my heart because here these guys had a good woman, and a child, didn't give a crap and took it for granted and in the mean time here I am can't even get one date and all I get is rejection after rejection. I just can't do it anymore. I am done. goodbye.",

            "selftext": "So here\u2019s my depression/anti-depressants story.\n\nI\u2019m 36F. Married, kids, career. I\u2019ve been on anti-depressants most of my adult life.\n\nI started taking anti-depressants in my early teens, post sexual assault, won\u2019t go into details, but I decided to seek help when my neighbor committed suicide and my first thought was \u201chey, that\u2019s a pretty good idea\u201d. Yeah. Anyway, I weened off meds in my mid-20s for having kids/nursing for about 3 years. Got back on the meds when I started having \u201cthey\u2019ll be better off without me\u201d thoughts. The final straw was watching a Seinfeld re-run where he\u2019s visiting his parents at their retirement community and I thought \u201cThis is not worth living for, gonna die eventually anyway, why not now?\u201d. So, back on the meds.\n\nFast forward about 7 years. Somehow, I got into the whole \u201cpharma is the devil, poison in your body\u201d BS. Weened off meds. In a span of a year off anti-depressants, I managed to put on 75 lbs and turn from a happy, outgoing, normal person to someone who just wants to die every day. I still plowed through taking care of my family and work obligations but I had to force myself to get out of bed every morning and any given chance, I\u2019d be mindlessly lying on the couch binge-watching Netflix. If kids were away at grandma\u2019s and hubby out of town, I would spend the entire time on the couch. I stopped going out with friends. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to the store and would only go if something couldn\u2019t be delivered. I stopped talking to people on the phone and would cringe when I had to make work calls. I work remotely so I did my best to do the absolute minimum just to keep my job. I turned from a highly organized neat freak into a pathetic lazy slob. Even taking a shower and shaving was a chore. And while part of me knew that I should do something about it, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to actually make an appointment until one day I got the gun out of the safe, walked into the bathroom, and thought that I should probably shoot myself in the shower so there\u2019d be less cleanup after because hubby would have to sell the house after. But then I thought - kids will come home from school and will find me and I just could not do that to them. I got in a car, drove to the nearest psychiatrist and just walked in and said I have to see a doctor, any doctor, immediately, all the while bawling my eyes out at the thought of my kids walking on my scattered brains.\n\nLong story short, a month later I am a different person. I\u2019m almost my old me, except I still have 50 lbs to lose (lost 25 lbs in one month, no gym yet, just getting off the fucking couch did the trick). I\u2019m the active and involved mom my kids used to have. I\u2019m on top of my shit at work. My house is spotless. I go out and do stuff with my friends. I host parties. I enjoy reading books again and barely watch any TV. I feel like a normal person again.\n\nNow, for the logical question - didn\u2019t anyone notice I was spiraling out of control? Well, I\u2019m very good at keeping up appearances and providing excuses. Weight gain? Yeah, it\u2019s a thyroid problem. Can\u2019t go volunteer at school or go to a dinner party? Sorry, busy at work. Can\u2019t attend company get-together? Sorry, busy with family. Can\u2019t go play with the kids? Sorry, too tired. Etc. My husband was going through job changes and traveled a lot during that time and was too stressed out to really pay attention.\n\nI\u2019m ok with the thought that I might be on anti-depressants forever. I talked to my doctor about possible alternative treatments in the future but I have to fully stabilize first.\n\nDepression is real. It is not some made-up shit that you can just shake off. Feeling sad once in a while is ok, feeling sad to the point when you stop enjoying every single thing you used to love is not ok. If you see someone\u2019s behavior change drastically, pay attention - they might be putting up a front that everything\u2019s ok but they might need help. Pharmaceuticals might be the devil but I can tell you, they work.\n\ntl;dr If you are depressed, seek help before it\u2019s too late.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, this is my first post here and I\u2019m not used to putting all my feelings into words, so it\u2019s likely going to come off as a rant. \n\nI\u2019ve suffered from depression on and off for a couple years, coupled with bouts of severe anxiety on top of my normal social anxiety. From the outside, no one knows, aside from three close friends. I manage to hide it very well, but the last few months have been daunting. \n\nMy mother has been diagnosed with about any psychiatric diagnosis you can have, has been admitted to 7 psychiatric facilities in the last 5 months, and has weaseled her way out every time. She drinks uncontrollably, is completely broke, and all of my time is consumed on whether she is going to kill herself, get a dui and kill someone else, or if my teenage sisters are safe, on top of stress from college. I withdrew from college last semester, and was adamant on pulling through this semester. Well, for the last month and a half I have barely gone to class, missed multiple exams, and missed a lot of coursework. \n\nI transformed from my bubbly, outgoing, extroverted, confident self to a sad, withdrawn, and apathetic shell. I have no drive to do anything, and am so lost in all aspects of my life. I just withdrew from this semester an hour ago, so 30k down the hole for this year. Finally was being proactive and started therapy two weeks ago, but may have to find someone new since it\u2019s through my uni. \n\nMy mother had another suicide attempt this week, and is now in another facility, and to top it off we are losing our house, power being shut off in a couple days and are completely broke. Luckily I have a lot of friends, and know that my sisters will have a place to go and I have an apartment at uni, but every aspect of my life is stressing me. I want to get better, I try to be proactive, but simple tasks are daunting. Instead of dressing up every day, I constantly look casual, wearing sweats more often going out than I did in years simply lounging in the house. My over the top skincare routine, especially for a dude, is non existent. Don\u2019t care on splurging on expensive body washes, and have been using 2 in 1 from bath and body works, as opposed to my normal $60 body wash and $30 a bottle shampoo and conditioner. It seems shallow, but those little luxuries brought me joy and security. I couldn\u2019t care less now. The convenience of using the 2 in 1 is less exhausting. \n\nMy friends joke around that I sleep too much, or sometimes am up all night, that I skip class. But they don\u2019t see my pain. No one does. But my facade is falling and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m hoping to start some ssris and better anti anxiety meds next week, but a week seems like an eternity. I\u2019m exhausted, and quite frankly broke myself now. I\u2019m used to having at least 4 months of bills saved up, which is a significant amount for a self sufficient 20 year old. But my accounts have been dwindling for months and I haven\u2019t even batted an eye. I never have gotten any money or support from my parents, not for car, credit cards, tuition, expenses, rent, even my cell phone. I\u2019ve worked so hard for the last three years to have what I do. Now, I\u2019m $100 short on my rent due next week, and although it\u2019s on my mind it doesn\u2019t seem like a worry. Nothing worries me, I\u2019m so blas\u00e9 to everything now, the complete opposite of my type A, over the top personality. I just wish someone could see it. But until then, I hope the therapy pans out, and I\u2019m able to get on some antidepressants. Because being so careless is more exhausting than planning and being over controlling every aspect of my life. And I miss that.",

Very recently though, I feel like I\u2019m experiencing a backslide. I have no motivation, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m crying a lot, and the part that I feel the worst about is a can\u2019t handle spending time with my friends.

I don\u2019t know what to do, why this is happening, or what\u2019s even causing these feelings (I can\u2019t tell apart what\u2019s going on in my head, it\u2019s such a ball of intertwined problems).

I helped a life there and now, today I lost one. Weird thing about it, when I came back home there was another bee in my house which I again caught and let free. It kinda felt like a sign or something. Funny how life and death mirror each other this way and how it comes out of nowhere. \nSorry for rant, just really depressed and had to share this with someone.",

            "selftext": "I was diagnosed with depression 4 long years ago. I first knew something was wrong when i was sitting on a ledge and ready to give up. I am scared of heights but at that moment i wasnt scared at all. I could dangle my feet off 15 floors high and had no fear. But people started pointing at me and a crowd was forming so i ran away. Went to the hospital and tada, depression. Was told to continue going but treatment was too expensive for my family. I just decided to deal with it. I was a straight A student but i dropped down to a 1.5 gpa average in just a few months. I struggled heavily academically.\n\nEverytime i feel happy, i feel guilty. Like i shouldnt be happy and happiness is wrong. I took a photo with a pikachu mascot. I was smiling ear to ear. Its the favourite photo of me to this day. But i remember going back to the hotel room after that and i attempted suicide. I just kept feeling like i did something terrible, i couldnt live with myself, i should just stop. \n\nI finally started interning as a preschool teacher, my dream job. I was happy, extremely happy. Very proud, first lesson went bad but the second lesson went well. Lessons after that went well and i became the class' form teacher in just a month. I was happy and i am happy. But i remember 2 weeks ago, i was teaching on happiness and kindess and i just felt guilty, i felt terrible. I just wanted to stop teaching at that moment. But i ignored that feeling and just continued. Here i am right now. Feeling the worst i have ever been. Thinking back, i am selfish. Everything has been about me. I have no friends other than the children. Im just tired and unhappy. Even if i try to be happy like those ppl who belittle depression say. I just cant be happy. I feel trapped, if im happy, i fall back, feeling worse than before. If i stay sad, i just dont want to continue anymore.",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the confusing title, I hope you can get the gist of it. i'll give my best to explain it. \n\nmy Depression really started to hit in about a Year ago now. I always knew during my school days it was lingering around but i tried everything to keep it away and hide it to people around me. Every one around me just saw the Mask i was wearing when i was outside or socially interactive and no one suspected me to have any sort of problems. Last year i got in a relationship, and about 3 Months in, the Depression hit me like a truck, i couldn't go to work or meet with friends. I didn't know how my GF would handle all this so i told her everything about me and my Feelings since i first noticed it. i told her about the fact that i would love to just stop existing. She said she wasn't able to understand what i feel like but she'll support me. she convinced me to see a Therapist and helped me wherever she could. My GF had to sacrifice a lot of fun because of me. I thought i didn't deserve someone like her and then i started thinking about it. I hate myself. there are  few things i would say i like about me. i see myself as a burden especially right now where i'm not able to get my  ass moving  without help.  i don't want to be a burden for someone else. Well my Gf cheated on me so at least, i could break up with her and don't have to think about beeing a burden for her. \n\nIt makes me want to scream internally. Now that I'm \"alone\" again i really want a Person in my life i can share anything with and just feel love. but at the same time i don't want to be burden to anyone. Even if she says its Ok i feel like i deprive her of her own life because she has to  handle someone like me. Even if her love is true i can't let it get to me because i hate my self so much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhas anyone of you the same Issue? or same kind of thought progress? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope it makes any kind of sense. i tried my best explaining it in english please don't lapidate me.",

            "selftext": "Disclaimer: this isn't any kind of cure lol. Just a neat trick I found that might make someone else's life a tiny bit easier.\n\n&gt; Christopher Winter M.D, sleep advisor for Men\u2019s Health, has said that if you get up at the same time every day, your brain will begin to get used to a specific schedule.\n\n&gt; But, if you go back to sleep, your brain gets confused and doesn\u2019t know what time it should tell your body to wake up, meaning your body doesn\u2019t get the usual hormone boost and consequently you feel like shit.\n\nOther sources talk about your body raising your temperature when it's time to wake up, and lowering it when it's time to sleep.\n\nOne of them claimed that a shitty sleep schedule can make your mornings groggy because you get the hormone/temperature boost, but at the wrong time, instead of when you actually wake up.\n\nWhat can depression do?\n\nWreak havoc with a regular sleep schedule.\n\nHow does it feel when you wake up at the wrong time, without the temperature boost?\n\n&gt; \"It becomes kind of like jet lag\u2026 You wake up feeling kind of groggy, like you have a dull headache, maybe a bit of nausea, and lethargy\u2014you just don\u2019t feel like doing anything.\"\n\nLike a crappy morning with depression. If you're used to similar depressive symptoms, you'd just be like oh, here we go again.\n\nI tried it out a few hours ago, and took a superhot shower. It didn't help my mood, but it definitely greased the wheels on getting ready for the day, and maybe that wasn't just ionization/conditioning. I'm going to try sitting in front of a space heater next time, and see if it helps too.\n\nEven if it does nothing for you guys, it's not like it's risky advice, so might be worth a shot?\n\nCaveat: if you live somewhere with extremely hot weather and every morning is already superheated, never mind me. Might help to cool your room down at night, but you probably already are and that's more of a hassle. Oh well.",

            "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI want to share with you my new way to deal with my disorders.\n\nI am living with chronic Depression since I was a child. I also have dependent personality disorder and self-harm disorder. I am currently 22 and was in a stationary therapy for 10 weeks and used many medications.\nNothing worked for me, the medication made me ill and therapy doesn't worked for me.\n\nI am working with self-discipline for a long time and it works really fine for me. I push myself to do all the things I would like to do and focus on my mind to reduce stress.\n\nMy live is really great, but I am still not happy.\nWhat I try now is a low-waist lifestyle.\nIt's not only because of the economic benefits.\nI am giving the things I have around me more value. If I need to buy new stuff, I chose the eco alternative for example bamboo toothbrush, solid shampoo.\nTidying up my home and making it well organized helps me with it.\nGiving my surrounding more value helps me a lot in living with depression and I didn't even know how I didn't came on that idea earlier.\nReducing plastic is like an inner and outer detox too. But most importantly: don't stress yourself by doing something good for you.\nI am not living 100% low-waist, I am doing it, how I like it.\n\n\nI hope I can help someone with my idea.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, it's my first time posting here and I'm not used to typing out long stories so I'm sorry if I sound out of place. I'm typically an extremely extroverted person. I make friends easily and always have comedy or chat material for every person. I'm described as nice, kind and sensitive to people's feelings. It's always me who listens to other's problems and console them like a therapist. However, every night I lie in bed, feeling like the loneliest person in the world. No matter how many friends I have, or how many chat groups or chats I have online. I'm always the one consoling others and I have no one to open up my feelings to. I feel so disconnected from this amazing huge galaxy and world we have. I feel like I'm alone in this tiny country in this tiny planet surrounded by all these people. I feel like no one feels what I feel. Why am I here? The world is so big and I'm nothing but a speck that will die off, the world moves on, the galaxy, and time moves on. I see posts about child slaves and feel sad for the day, then I go back to happily commenting on a cute animal post. Everything, every feeling, every event passes on, and here I am. I'm in the center of it all, and yet so disconnected. Recently I played Red Dead Redemption 2 (Video games take me to a world where I'm the connector to the world, it makes me feel significant, loved, and surrounded), and the ending and storyline made me feel so much that I can't describe it. I often find myself crying at the death's, thoughts and personalities of the characters that I won't ever meet. I often find myself crying in bed at how I wish for a game life I can't have. I have everything: friends, grades, a good life, a loving family and opportunities all around me. Yet I just want to end it all, why? I'm so lost in the endless universe.",

Busted my ass so I could graduate from an expensive university, had to work full time while my mom helped with my rent and sometimes food expenses (I had to move to another city). I managed to graduate debt free but I am still tired.  \nI don't have a great social life because my income does not allow me to have one and it only helps pay for my expenses (rent, food, internet and sometimes I can take my girlfriend for dinner once a month). The little money I can manage to save I always end up spending because something always comes up (health issues, apartment maintenance, car maintenance, etc).  \nI don't have a great diet and my family from both sides are diabetic, have heart problems or both.  \nI was unemployed for 4 months before my current job and managed to sustain myself because when my dad died, I inherited some money.  \nI had a promising job with a good above average salary for but that was once on a lifetime kind of job and my boss died. Where I currenty work, they pay me half of what I did and I am working 70-80 hours a week.  \nRight now I'm only working to survive, without anychance of any salarial raise and no other opportunity has appeared. I've been patient for 8 months and I'm fed up.  \nWhen I get home I immedietly cook dinner, I take a bath, wash my working clothes and just sleep 4 to 5 hours just to wake up early to get to work.\n\n(I don't live in the States, I live in Dominican Republic; it's the big island in the Caribbean.)\n\nMonthly expenses\n\n\\- My rent: 200 dollars  \n\\- Food expenses: 80 dollars  \n\\- Gas expenses: 80 dollars (In my country a gallon of regular gas is 5 dollars)  \n\\- Internet, electricity and water: 60 dollars\n\nTOTAL: 420 dollars\n\nMy salary  \n\\- Monthly salary: 450 dollars\n\nDebt:  \n\\- Credit card: 100 dollars  \n\\- Rent: 50 (I owe this because I had to use some of the rent money to go to emergency)\n\nIn my country it's hard to climb because usually you have an opportunity only if you know important people or you have close family member who is a politician\n\nI don't know what to do. I hate this life and I am thinking I should just end it. What's the point in working if I can't enjoy life? This is not life, I work to pay my bills, so I can get home to sleep so I can wake up early. Sometimes I manage to get 3 to 4 hours of free time a week.",

I\u2019m not afraid of death, I\u2019m afraid of what comes before it. I would be in a better place if I would just do it. Suffering like this for years is not something I want to be a part of. I\u2019m on meds, I do therapy, nothing helps. And who would want to be with someone like me? Someone who\u2019s so fucked up in the head and sad all the time? No one. No one wants that.

This hasn\u2019t really negatively impacted my energy throughout the day but I really enjoy sleeping and really don\u2019t enjoy laying in bed for hours trying to fall back to sleep.\n\nI see that insomnia is listed as an adverse event on the product info and I\u2019m wondering if this is something that goes away as I get used to the drug or something I\u2019ll need to deal with from now on?

            "selftext": "I have a close circle of friends and they know about my demons and that's fine because their there for me but recently someone outside of this group found out and they told everyone at my school. I'm not necessarily annoyed at this person, lets say Karen, for doing this because its obvious and a lot of my other friends with depression have come out about it and they're getting a good response but it was their choice and I didn't want people to find out. It's making me really upset and when people bring it up I don't know who to respond. \n\nRight now I've been making a few jokes and making it clear that I'm still the same person but it's really tough and I don't know what to do. To make matters worse recently, because everyone already knows, I've been sharing my thoughts on people and whether their depressed or faking it (which is an opinion I'm entitled to have because as many of you guys reading this know, depression drowns you and for people to fake it, is petty and I think they don't deserve the attention they crave, regardless of what they're doing to themselves) and recently one of my closet friends has decided to share to people that she thinks say I'm not depressed and that I cant say others aren't, even though shes never been depressed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really confused and I need some advice; to sum up, everyone has found out about my depression and I don't know how to react. Plus my close friend has decided to say that I'm not depressed and I'm not entitled to have an opinion on those who are faking depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: this is my first time properly posting so forgive me for it being a bit strange. Also, I really like this close friend and I don't want to ruin our friendship I just don't know what to say to them.",

This will be a presentation made up of letters from you, the general public, about your experiences with mental illness. The purpose of this play is to help normalize these issues as well as provide a catharsis for those that may be suffering.\nSubmissions can be completely anonymous. \n\nHelp Andy Batt make a great show about depression. \n\nThat description did not do it justice. This is gonna be cool.\n\nFrom Andy:\nSo I am finally returning to the world of directing.  And not just directing, but crafting the show as well.  I really need all your help in spreading the word.  If you or a loved one have experience with depression/suicide, please share this.  I want to reach as many people as possible to create this show.\n\nAugust 29-31 &amp; September 5-7 MadLab will present Fine Not Fine.  Admittedly, I basically ripped off the format from a show we presented at the Lab back in 2004 called Dear George: Letters to the President.  But basically we'll be soliciting letters from anyone and everyone about their experiences with depression/suicide.  Below is the official synopsis and submission guidelines, and I've included the page on MadLab's website with all the same basic information if you'd prefer to see it that way.\n\nThanks!\n\nSYNOPSIS:\nDepression may be the biggest health epidemic facing the world today, and still a person suffering from depression is regarded as weak or less than human.  Fine Not Fine attempts to help normalize depression by showing how it affects people from all walks of life.  Fine Not Fine is a collection of letters and statements from the general public about their experiences with depression. These statements will be woven into a theatrical tapestry and will be brought to life by some of the best performers Columbus has to offer.\n\nSUBMISSION GUIDELINES:\n- The deadline for submissions will be May 10, 2019 \n-If you would like to submit anonymously, please fill out a form here:  [link](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CSRBYCN) \n- Due to length of the play, not all letters submitted will be used.\n- Letters can be of any length, but this may have an effect on the usability of the letter.\n- Letters can be about your own depression, your experience with the depression of those around you, or anything of the like.  We only ask that you not tell someone else\u2019s story without their expressed permission.\n- Letters should be true stories of your experience with depression.  We are not looking for fictionalized stories.\n- Letters that are accepted will be read in their entirety, however, letters may be \u201csegmented\u201d for theatrical presentation.",

            "selftext": "Whenever I masturbate, I always feel MORE depressed and suicidal, specifically after orgasm. Sometimes it gets so bad, I lose all control and actually start carrying out my suicide plans. Does this happen to other people or is this just me????\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore:\n\nI've been diagnosed with atypical depression and schizoid personality disorder after being warded for a suicide attempt and now on Prozac. Used to obssess about suicide literally all the time but ever since I got meds, it's become maybe an hourly, or on good days, once a day occurrence. All in all, except for a few stupid side effects (drowsiness, a ridiculously big appetite), things have gotten alot better. It has been a while since I felt like I was on the brink of actually committing suicide. I've been feeling really horny lately (weird because apparently Prozac is supposed to kill your sex drive) and whenever that happens, I masturbate. However, after orgasm, my mood ALWAYS plummets and I end up feeling seriously suicidal. This is the only time I feel like I seriously want to commit suicide (right there right now) and sometimes I even start carrying out my plans. Usually when that happens, I force myself to sleep (I only masturbate at night) and when I wake up the next morning I feel fine again. This has nothing to do with guilt about sinning or whatever because I'm not religious and come from a pretty sex positive family. I think it has something to do with feeling intensely lonely. But the thing is, I'm a loner most of the time (by choice) and most of the time, I feel great about it. Just after masturbating is about only time I genuinely feel lonely. I'm not a bad looking person and plenty of decent people have expressed interest in hooking up or getting into a relationship with me. But the thing is, I can't bring myself to have sex with someone else. Not because I'm incapable of sexual attraction but because in every sexual situation I've been in, I genuinely felt like they are invading my personal space. The problem now is that now I know that masturbation triggers the return of my suicidal thoughts but I am unable to satisfy my sexual urges in any other way. Having to choose between being sexually frustrated and suicidal is really shitty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo:\n\n\\- does this happen to other people?\n\n\\- is there a scientific explanation for this happening?\n\n\\- how do I stop it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfor your reference I'm a girl and this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons but I'll be logging back in to reply to comments if any",

I can't fix her and neither can she fix me but I would appreciate her putting some more effort into taking care of herself.  \n\nBut at the end of the day I am limited to trying to be a good friend which entails being there for her, praising her when she does something good, encouraging her to get out and doing things that are healthy and active, doing other activities together every now and then instead of drowning in our sorrows at the bar, etc.\n\nI think what sucks most is that she doesn't quite understand the depth of my depression and then continues to vent and complain about her situation and how it's impossible to fix the problems in her life. We've had a serious talk at one point about how it's hurting me when she does this constantly. So she's held back from doing it every now and then, but then she will ask me permission to vent and complain. At that point, I feel like the bad guy if I say no. \n\nRelationships are complicated, man. You want to be there for the other person but then they drive you insane. Which leads to resentment. And then leads to apathy. And then you wonder why you even try. Which leads to reinforcing your own mind with positive memories together. And then you have a talk with them. But then the same problems surface again later on. You get exhausted and again wonder why you even try or when will it end?",

I miss my therapist, I miss being loved, i miss how I felt when I was dating her. It was also all false though. I was stepping on eggshells because I thought I cared but it was because I was insecure in my own relationship. I wasn\u2019t sure who I was without her and now here I am more unsure and anxious than ever. Part of me will always care and want to be with her, but I also want to move on.

Any laughing or crying or anger? It's all completely superficial. I realized this the other day when my mind wandered into what I would react like if so and so happened, and I just realized I wouldn't. I just wouldn't react. I talked to my psychiatrist and she didn't have any answers except to talk to the therapist, who is on a 'self-love' topic currently. Thing is, I believe that in order to start self loving, you need to have some basis, even if it's tiny, of care for something. And I just don't. I really don't. I could pack up and fly away across the country right now, and not miss anyone back home. I don't think there's any coming back from this.",

I get this feeling of worthlessness and thoughts that make me feel like complete shit this feeling use to come and go but now it's constantly here and won't go away  and I hate it.

My desire was to have someone who could understand for years and I recently thought I found one but alas she is quite unresponsive and it has kind of pushed me over the edge. \nMy parents are supportive of my suicide and showered me with expensive rubbish to try and calm me down for the past couple of years, they never attempted to send me for any therapy whatsoever etc.\n\nAt college I\u2019m seen as an outcast and ignored by most. Even when I feel that i have a connection I\u2019m immediately dumped for one that has been known for longer. I\u2019m very clingy and that has repelled people. I struggle with speaking to others and I\u2019m extremely clumsy which has merely ruined what little reputation I have.\n\nMy best friend who did understand me died a couple of years ago thanks to suicide and he did help me get out of a few depressing times \nI don\u2019t want to disappoint him but I just can\u2019t do it anymore.\n\nIf you do care don\u2019t be sorry of my death.

            "selftext": "Here lies the root of all my problems: **lack of like-ability**, whatever that is. I wish I was born with a different facial makeup or different proportions of the body. The combination of my look and tiredness built up over the past years is now soaking my life with misery.\n\nPeople think I am normal, but I am very abnormal: I just cannot develop a meaningful relationship.\n\nOnly with shrewd moves to develop a friendship, I managed to get inside two groups for the past 29 years. \n\nMy complete lack of athletic ability exacerbated the problem. In the state where I grew up, it was common for kids to play ball and develop some kind of friendship. I could never make the cut for any team. I had virtually no close group of friends in my early teenage years, and that developed myself into a loner. I developed relationships with a few persons, but I just could not maintain the relationship, primarily because no one wants to see the same person 24/7.\n\nThis problem--typically faced by people when people grow up and overcome sometime in their life--never was solved in my life. In fact, it exacerbated and became very much a real world problem in college.\n\nI could not develop a close network of friends nor could I develop a mentor who could guide my career. The first difficulty was that I could not get any information on which courses to take or which study aids to use. I took courses no freshmen should be allowed to take and destroyed my first semester grades.  Career counsels should be damned because when I went there for some mentorship, they were very talented in discouraging me from choosing practical majors--even though that was what I really should have studied. To retrospect, they had some kind of a secret mission to discourage students from choosing business majors and preserve the liberal art integrity of the school. They chose me as the scapegoat. Had I at least chosen a practical major, I would have landed a better job and use that job as a leverage to develop a relationship. But that didn't happen. \n\nDespite these obstacles, I tried. I got interview opportunities during my junior and senior year. But I could not impress the interviewers. Rather, I was always paralyzed when they tried to press me into the corner to see how I react. And it also didn't help that I was taking depression medication from the long period of isolation and loneliness and depression made me lose my brain power. \n\nAfter moving into my parents' house for nearly one year after graduation and spending time there, I managed to land a job. But it also didn't go well. I couldn't stop but to compare myself with all other people who were so confident in themselves and their looks. I became more and more insecure everyday. Probably the company I worked for hired me because my academic credentials were okay, but I ended up disappointing others in the company because my productivity was continuously compromised by insecurity. Grades ,credentials, and momentary sparks seemed to indicate I should perform okay, but with insecurity over my personality and my looks, I just could not concentrate well on my work or self-development. \n\nI took another job but was laid off there. One of my supervisors told me my work was okay, but my problem was that I seemed incapable of devoting myself to the gig, maybe due to the lost opportunity of studying business-which I was actually more interested in--or going to going to graduate school.\n\nNow I am at the point of life crisis again. Maybe I should have dated more and played more in college to build up my confidence, but I didn't have such opportunity, and now those with such confidence are easily surpassing me--because they are doing what they want to do and not get compromised by insecurity or depressin medication.",

My beautiful car has been destroyed and I\u2019ve felt guilty about it every since. I was baker acted and released and put on anti depressants and they worked for a little while. I was just overlooked at work for a promotion and I feel like the world is crashing down on me. I don\u2019t want to continue living anymore. I struggle with bills and day to day activities. I feel like I work super hard but I have nothing to show for it. I just feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life. Everyone around me is celebrating something, a promotion, their boyfriend asking them to move in, having a baby, getting married or finally getting a house. I just feel like I deserve those things. I want those things. Every time someone brings up those things or mentions it, it\u2019s hard for me to be happy for them and I feel so guilty. I don\u2019t know how to get over this hump. I\u2019m breaking down and I\u2019m finally getting the help I need but it\u2019s just not enough right now. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

I know it's not a big problem but for me it's a big thing. I don't have anyone to share this with. i wish i had someone who would hug me. My dad was always angry, disappointed and sad that I've never achieved something in life or couldn't make them proud. I've noticed my thoughts getting more and more grey.

            "selftext": "Throw away account for reasons. Feeling like I'm at rock bottom. I know things could be worse but I just dont know what to do. My life has been going downhill over the last half a year. Bit of a long story but I just want to get it off my chest and maybe someone will listen.\n\nSo to start the story off I moved away from my hometown into a city a few hours away about 6 years ago. I was at college, had a bunch of friends that lived here, met an amazing girl who we spent a few years together in a relationship. Fast forward August time last year when she fell out of love and ended our relationship. I was truly heartbroken. \n\nSo a little more context, there is a night every week that i have been going to in the city since I moved here 6 years ago. It's a music event that I am passionate about. So around the same time me and my ex split up the photographer at this night I go to retired and then I was offered to take his place as the resident photographer for the  night everyweek. Felt like this was a great opportunity as I was freshly graduated and something I was really passionate about. I done it for about 4 months which was really tough mentally as my ex still goes and i would need to see here there most weeks. This sucked but was manageable with some mutual respect for each other but one night in December she done something that really hurt me and messed me up mentally for a while. I cancelled any photography jobs that were coming up that she might be at and quit the weekly photography job I was doing for that night. \n\nThis is were I realised how much my life sucks now. Most of my friends had already moved away from the city and a bunch of people were mutual friends with me and my ex who I dont see anymore either. I've never felt as alone in my life. But it was at around this point I started having serious gut problems. I'm in pain everyday with my guts been in and out of hospital trying to find out what is wrong and so far we have just hit a dead end and have no answers yet. I lay in bed thinking I'm dying many many nights. I'm scared of dying and not because my life will end but because of the pain that will tear through my family. I'm really close to my family and it's the only thing making me want to keep living. But my family is going through some real troubles with mental health which is causing a lot of stress and difficulties (my mum has bipolar, my little sister (12) has been diagnosed with asperger's and my little brother (11) has some really hard times with mental health and the doctors think he has autism.\n\nSo quick recap thats relationship, friends, family and health all gone to shit a bit. Now I've had a wage arrestment on my income from some debt I have and they are taking a portion of my wages. So i am making meets end but I never have enough money to do anything nice even though all I do is work or sit at home myself. Now I know people have it worse and I could be worse of but I feel like everything that could go to shit is going to shit.\n\nBack to the photography work I do for that night. I took 3 months off and they wanted me to come back. I spent 3 months doing nothing but feel sorry for myself and this is something that makes my life seem somewhat less mundane. But ever since that bad night that happened I get filled with anxiety before going. From hours before right up until I get there my anxiety is going through the roof. I was doing alright with is, been back for about 6 weeks but this week my ex was there and I have to watch her get drunk jump about with people then leave with guys while i go home myself to lie in my bed with all my thoughts. \n\nI should note that I still love her and I'm struggling to get over it. It's been about 7 months since we broke up and I still think about her everyday. Now I really dont know how to move forward. Do I just suck it up and keep doing these nights because 1. It's something I want to do. 2. I need the extra money it pays. 3. It's probably the most interesting thing happening in my life at the moment. Or do I call it a day because it is really messing with my mental health and leaving me feeling like shit on many occasions.\n\nI'm just lost and alone and dont know that to do. Thanks if you have read this absolute pile of gibberish this far. I just had to tell someone how I'm feeling",

I love my life, I consider myself talented, I have a caring, inspiring and loving girlfriend, a supportive family and am relatively healthy.\n\nI think I am depressed. I struggle to motivate myself to do anything productive, or even enjoyable. I often can't motivate myself to get out of bed. While I love what I do, I can rarely push myself to do it unless someone else is on my back. I find keeping up with admin and communicating with people I work with almost impossible, even though there is very little to do. I find myself stuck in the addictive algorithms of YouTube for hours at a time, knowing that I would rather be doing something else, but being completely unable to motivate myself to stop watching sub 5 minute pop science and classic car videos for 4 hours at a time.\n\nI want to work more, make more, learn more, push my boundaries and embrace the spectacularly beautiful existence that I perceive. I want to see friends, call my siblings, meet new people and do new things.\n\nI'm not suicidal, but I fear that it is inevitable. I'm convinced that I am going to end up killing myself, even though I don't want to. Sometimes I get lost in the falseness of reality. Not 'fake people' or 'fake friends' but the idea that nothing really 'exists' at all, which can be liberating, terrifying, exhilarating and debilitating in equal measure.\n\nI don't like to think that I am depressed, because I'm not. I find colourful happiness in the smallest and most mundane of moments. People who are depressed are sad. I am sad, but when the coffee stains on an unwashed mug can make me happy its hard to push for anything more. Maybe that's why I'm fucking broke.\n\nI called the GP to book an appointment. None available. What do I do now?\n\nI'm performing some improvised noise music at a Vennart gig later. Can't wait to experience these feelings as sound. I hope people listen.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m not necessarily depressed but borderline at the very least, not suicidal at all I\u2019m just stuck in a constant mindset. I\u2019m almost 18 and I moved to the Capital city of my country about a year ago to go work for my grandfather getting decent money, I have my own flat and I live alone. I\u2019ve been here awhile and have all the things I ever wanted to buy e.g. car, fancy gadgets, good food. I should be happy right? The truth is I just have no one to talk to and I\u2019ve made 0 friends since moving here so all my free time is spent in my room with nothing but my thoughts and my things. The only people I interact with is my work colleagues, parents time to time on the phone and messaging friends from back home (but it\u2019s usually like the same conversation over and over with all of them. Not the same as real life contact anyways). I\u2019m not a bad looking guy, have good fashion sense, charisma, I look after myself, I could easily go out there and make some friends but I just have no drive nor would I know where to start since I can\u2019t hit the clubs till another couple months. I\u2019ve been following the same routine for months and it\u2019s literally skull numbing. Surely this isn\u2019t what the real world is like? I also smoke marijuana daily and I\u2019m stoned from the moment I get home till the moment I fall asleep. I\u2019m not an idiot I know this probably plays a huge role in the way I\u2019m feeling but it\u2019s my escape front the world and it\u2019s the only thing that makes me mildly content for awhile, been smoking it for years not always daily but I honestly have a type of love for it and don\u2019t wanna give it up. I\u2019ve cut down heaps recently, tried breaks, but the way I feel hasn\u2019t changed at all. So to break it down I\u2019m stuck in life doing the same thing and I feel like a mouse on a spinning wheel. I spend my days 8-5pm work, get home shower, other chores etc then go to my room have a few bongs and watch YouTube videos till I go to sleep around midnight. Every. Single. Day. In the weekends all I do is sit in my room doing the same thing or I might go for a drive to clear my head. I know someone is going to suggest finding a hobby and I\u2019ve tried many of things but I usually lose interest after a couple of days or a couple of weeks. I want to avoid seeing a therapist because I\u2019ve had bad experiences in the past and it\u2019s just not my thing in general... I feel like such a sob posting my story but I just wanna see if there\u2019s anybody else out there going through the same thing or have gone through this in the past. And if so, how did you overcome it? Even if you\u2019re perfectly normal I\u2019ll still appreciate your comment. Thank you for reading and I apologise for formatting/grammar mistakes, posting from mobile.",

            "selftext": "Hey reddit users, I\u2019m not sure if this is depression but its changes I\u2019ve noticed happening in my life over the last year or so, and to be quite honest most of it scares me. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m posting on here is because we recently had a mental health class at uni which got me thinking about myself, and how I\u2019ve been feeling in recent years, i think it will be easier for me to just get stuck into the main things I\u2019ve noticed changing in my life, like they are subtle but i think they have probably been getting me down for longer than i had first thought. \n\n1. Memory - i think this is the killer for me, its the biggest thing I\u2019ve noticed change in the last few years, it honestly scares be because i used to have a really good memory, but i am forever forgetting stuff that happened recently or literally 5 minutes ago. As I\u2019ve said i only noticed this in the last year or two, and my friend mentioned on a trip that it could be linked to mental health. \n\n2. Sleep pattern - so this is another thing i noticed even more recently. I used to be able to solidly go to bed at 10pm and wake up like clock work for 7am every day, 7 days a week. But in about the last year or so, this has slowly got worse. I still go to bed at the same time, but i find I\u2019m sleeping till much later the next morning. This is new to me because i never feel as refreshed as i used to, and if i try waking up for 7am now, its almost impossible leaving me with real difficulty staying awake for the rest of the day. \n\n3. Overall happiness - this is again, something i didn\u2019t really consider till very recently when i started talking to a girl. I won\u2019t talk about her but happiness has been going over and over my mind recently. I dont remember the last time i actually felt happy, maybe its a bit of social pressure, the whole get rich quick scenario going on in social media, that whole stereotype of money making you happy, i dunno. I just dont remember being happy, i feel ok every day, just not necessarily \u201chappy\u201d. \n\nIm sorry if this was a bit vague, life feels like that atm with me about to Finnish uni, the uncertainty of what next... I\u2019m just interested to know wether any of you experienced any of this? Because i know i cant keep going on like this, its making me exhausted, and i dont know if i should seek help from a doctor or not for medication. Im already on meds for bad migraine relief. \n\nThanks for reading if you got this far, it means allot for someone to listen.",

            "selftext": "So for better understanding I'll start from the beginning. When I was in my last year in high school, my mother was raped by her boss. Instead of th company acting on this they paid her a large sum of money, gave her the company car and let her go. The family struggled emotionally but we coped. Then my parents found out I am gay and the shit show started. I was threatened, things got physical and I was thrown out the house for a month or so. And not long after that my mother was diagnosed with cancer. She went in for surgery and had a stroke, she has limited use of her right hand and has seizures occasionally. The medical expenses were steep and the medical aid would only pay partially. My parents had warmed up to me being gay and things seemed calm for a while. My parents invested a large sum of money into a business venture that then failed leaving us in some financial trouble. My dad then found a job and things were fine again until he was recently retrenched due to the company doing badly.\n\nI am full time engineering student. I help out a fuck ton at home and try my best to not get my brother involved in anything rough as he is finishing his final year at HS. On top of this I got a part time job to kind of help around the house but this is all so emotionally taxing. Yesterday I has an 8 hour lab session that I think was the tipping point of it all and I lost my temper. A man was parked in the middle of the road, blocking my way out of campus. I lost it and tried to swerve around him but ended up hitting his car. I panicked and tried to make a run for it and he caught up to me. I'm scared he's going to press charges against me. I ensured him the Insurance will pay out. But I just feel like there's no escaping drama in my life. This is all my fault and I don't know how to dig my way out.\n\nToday I went to visit a therapist. It helped to speak to someone. But I still just don't know if I can handle life anymore. I haven't been happy years. I'm slowly losing touch with who I am. I just can't anymore.",

            "selftext": "3 days ago my life changed because I finally spoke to someone. \n\nI\u2019ve been suffering for the past 3 years or so. I lost my dream job, found a lump near my testical and started shitting blood which convinced me that I had cancer. Instead of going to see a doctor, I kept it a secret as I was petrified of the truth and seeing my family suffer. We\u2019ve all been through a lot recently with my mum having her leg amputated and my brother going to prison for molesting my younger sister. The thought of me having cancer on top of everything that\u2019s happened took me to a terrible place physically and mentally.\n\nI\u2019ve lost a lot of weight during this time, to the point where I get weird looks for being so skinny. I\u2019ve stopped socializing, stopped talking to girls, completely lost all motivation and find myself forgetting almost everything I read or hear. Its like my head is totally empty and lifeless. \nI was the complete opposite before all of this, during high school I was always out with friends, I had a sex life and I was super motivated to do well in life. \nIt's hard seeing your old self slowly fade away in to what feels like a void of time and space.\n\nThe only reason I spoke out was because I had 100% convinced myself that the end was near and I felt it was only fair to tell my parents the truth. I was sleepier than ever. Id wake up after a good nights sleep and instantly want to go back to sleep again, I wasn't hungry (even more so than usual), I had stomach pains and my mental state had taken a real turn for the worse which before I had always kept under control (sorta). I\u2019ve now learnt these are all symptoms of depression but they\u2019re also symptoms of cancer (according to google) so it really messed me up.\n\nAfter telling my parents I finally got medical attention, I\u2019ve had my blood tested for everything under the sun and I\u2019m booked in next week for a full body scan and to see a urologist. My Doctor reckons the lump is a cyst and the blood is hemorrhoids but obviously I'm getting checked to be sure, so fingers crossed!\n\nI\u2019m writing this because I'm sure there\u2019s other people out there that might be severely depressed to due health concerns and I just wanted to tell those people that its not as bad as your mind thinks it is. Go to your doctor and tell him/her everything and I mean everything, it helps like you can't even imagine. Please don't do what I did and work yourself up to the point of a full mental breakdown. I know it's easier said than done but maybe if I had read this a couple years ago I could\u2019ve saved myself sooner? Who knows but if this helps 1 person then that's good enough.\n\nAnyways for the first time since I can remember, I felt a warm fuzzy feeling in my stomach. It only lasted for an hour before I fell asleep last night but it felt so, so good! It was a brief but wonderful glimpse of happiness. I\u2019m still pretty fucked up, my head is still all over the place and it'll probably take time before im me again but i\u2019ve just started taking medication and having that one brief moment of legitimate happiness is proof that things will get better.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, I find myself not knowing where to turn so I wanted to post in this community to gather opinions. I have briefly struggled with social anxiety, but recently myself and those close to me have been seeing a change that I\u2019m unsure of whether or not to class as depression. I wouldn\u2019t have ever thought of myself having depression, Im not losing the will to live or feeling numb and exhausted, but rather I\u2019m just finding myself sad and empty a lot of the time. Sometimes I\u2019m perfectly fine and happy, but then for days at a time I find myself unable to pull myself out of feeling sad and crying a lot. Like, a lot. Sometimes I don\u2019t even understand why I\u2019m crying, but I can\u2019t stop it. \n\nFor context, I don\u2019t have many (1 here and 1 in another country) friends and really tend to rely on my boyfriend a fair bit. I\u2019m so lonely but for some reason I take weeks to reply to those friends. I\u2019ve recently started a very full on science degree which is stressing me out a lot and I\u2019ve actually lost a lot of friends recently due to cutting them out. Ive also noticed myself enjoying things a lot less, I used to be an avid reader and crafter but I\u2019ve pretty much stopped everything and all I do in my spare time is study or scroll through reddit. I struggle to sleep sometimes/sleep extremely lightly. I\u2019m already planning on going back to my psychologist to have her assess it, but to me what I\u2019m displaying is not the symptoms of typical depression and I guess I just wanted to hear how everyone experiences it. Maybe I\u2019m just stressed and lonely and that\u2019s affecting my mental health? I\u2019m not sure. I feel like my life is the best it\u2019s ever been (I\u2019ve recently just lost 15 kilos, I love the degree I\u2019m studying, have a wonderful supportive partner and have recently moved out of home) but for some reason, I\u2019m the saddest I\u2019ve ever felt. I feel so desperate because I used to be so optimistic, and I hate the shell of a person I\u2019ve become. Does anyone else experience depression through this extremely sad and lonely lense? Or am I really far off base for thinking I could be suffering from mild depression?",

            "selftext": "It's a long one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could have posted this on a comment to another post, and I nearly did. I saw it had a lot of comments, and I realised that no one would *hear me.* It's not that I want attention, I just want someone to *acknowledge* how I'm feeling. I want it to be validated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no friends. I moved to be with my partner a couple of years ago about 2 hours away from my family. Things aren't going well with us either. An example is that he's getting back from (yet another) week away working in London, and he's making plans to go out with his friends instead of spending time with me.  We've been arguing a lot, and I feel like I'm absolutely useless. I've told him I'm suffering from depression, but he doesn't seem to understand it. He gets back usually, complains at me that the house is messy and then does his own thing. When I don't have the motivation to do anything, he just then complains that we don't do anything together anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe big thing I do wrong (well, my partner tells me it's a big thing), is when he's away I smoke. He doesn't like it, and will make a huge deal if he catches me. In my head, it's my 10 minutes of headspace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I'm just being picky, or if something is wrong with me. But I'm not even sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore. I'm a shitty girlfriend at the moment, and I don't know if he's not understanding or if I'm just overthinking it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just about manage work, and I manage to walk the dogs (most days). I do my best with the house but sometimes I just want to sit and do nothing. I've got lots of hobbies, although the only one I constantly take part in is Horse Riding. I feel as though it's almost a therapy session. My teacher is always telling me how well I'm doing, and I feel as though she really does listen to me. I do that once a week, and I feel good when I do it. It's the one thing I never let myself cancel, no matter how little motivation I have beforehand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've contemplated suicide, but that's not an option for me. I also write letters to the Samaritans, and occasionally I self-harm (Although this is becoming rarer out of determination). I'm just stuck in a black hole which is swallowing me up, and I don't even know where to start with a solution. When I last spoke to a GP, they just told me to \"exercise\" because my issues were too deep-rooted for drugs to help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want some actual support, but I don't even know where to turn to. My parents are worried about me, but they can't do anything so I don't really tell them the extent of what's going on. My partner isn't exactly supportive either.   \n\n\nThank you for reading all of this. I really do appreciate it.",

I attempt to put on a smile, but underneath that smile lays a broken soul of failure and sadness that isn\u2019t visible to the naked eye, depression haunts me. I have a great family, great friends, a great therapist, but the emotional pain is insufferable. I had a great few weeks but once again the evil thoughts are back telling me that maybe I\u2019m better off not here. I have many thoughts of my grandfather who was my role model, I still remember kissing him on the forehead as he was dying and saying my last goodbyes to him, that hurts me a lot.",

I thought about suicide alot over the past couple of months, sometimes I feel like it's something I just got to do..I think when I do it, my parents would mourn..of course, but I'd like to think that maybe..just maybe that I helped them move on with their lives, that they can be happy and not worry about their son. I don't mean to go off on a rant but..they don't know how I'm feeling, I don't show it to them..I don't really know what to do anymore to be honest. I wake up every morning to the same routine and go to bed with this pain and depression in me every night. There were times when I'd be walking home from class at night just hoping that someone would do something..I've had people manipulate me..I thought maybe I could help someone out in situations but she only talked to me when she needed something..and like a fool, I gave in all the time. I'm sorry if this rant is incoherent..but to whomever reads this, thank you for being there.",

            "selftext": "Over a year ago I had a suicide attempt that I was voluntarily hospitalized for and in the few months following that still struggled with serious thoughts of suicide but eventually decided that I\u2019d rather exist, even if I\u2019m a complete failure, than be dead since virtual reality would allow me to live whatever life I\u2019d want in the near future. But after recovering further I decided \u201cfuck that\u201d and tried getting my shit together again only to end up on a path to a similar situation now. To provide more context I\u2019m a CS student at a 4 year university who has struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember and I have already taken two academic leaves and now am at risk of being suspended for poor academic performance. Most of my grades are As and Bs aside from the two Fs that I got when I was already taking a fairly light load which put me in this situation. After going through a lot shit over the past three years (most of which I was on leave) and putting in a lot of work between school and working part time jobs to pay for school related costs and medical bills, I\u2019m only 21% of the way towards graduating and have been making less and less progress each quarter. I\u2019ve tried therapy while at school, while away from school, medication (which screwed me up for several months), taking a lighter load/easier classes and really nothing has gotten better; I at least used to enjoy lectures and readings, etc. but I absolutely hate that now too and haven\u2019t been to class in weeks although I\u2019m still submitting homework assignments and taking exams since I don\u2019t want to completely throw in the towel. That being said I know that the quarter is about to start ramping up in difficulty and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to make it, especially since I\u2019m too anxious to go to lectures. I\u2019ve considered dropping out altogether in the past but I feel like that is not going to go well but it\u2019s either that, fuck up the quarter and get suspended anyway, or end up in a hospital again trying to push through it. I don\u2019t really care about schoolwork anymore, nor do I see myself graduating at this point but I also don\u2019t want to let everything go to shit and have no options. I just feel like I\u2019m in limbo and I have just been spinning wheels for the past three years and ultimately wasting time. I can\u2019t just keep barely inching forward towards a degree indefinitely either for several reasons. I just don\u2019t see any kind of hopeful future in the near or long term and feel like I\u2019m starting to slip back into the severely depressed and suicidal state I was in despite having come up with many reasons against suicide. There\u2019s no one I can really talk to either since I\u2019ve heard what my family has to say about my situation 1000 times already and I have no other social connections. Just completely stuck and know that things are about to get ugly real soon.",

It just sucks that I'm trying to do something about it, but it still manages to drag me down. Like it's telling me to just end it and I've got no hope. Feels bad, man.",

As a result, i've become bitter, cynical and even an asshole. I think i've been trying to dawn the whole 'I dont give a shit' attitude. As a result, i lost sight of who I am.

He talks about how being sad can become a habit and it's important to remember that although sadness has its place in life, it's natural and healthy that it end, and that I should try to only be sad about something that makes me sad for an appropriate time. I should use a whole bunch of different methods to pull myself out when it's time, like mindfulness and specific coping methods. \nI'm trying all that. I'm trying. But it's my understanding that life is not supposed to be this bad all the time and that realistically there should be gaps in the misery that make it all worth it. I just don't see those as often as I wish I did. I don't want to be sad all the time. I feel like I'm almost starting to just enjoy the sadness. I don't want that. I want to be happy sometimes.

I hate scrolling through my feed looking for memes, just to see some whore posting pictures of her 5th boyfriend of the year. Or some kids who treated me like shit going to a \"lit party\" to get wasted. I envy the relationships and fun that im missing out on as a teenager, almost young adult. But I left for a fucking reason. \n\nAll these kids care about is being fuckboys/whores, smoking weed, and talking like their favorite rappers. Its so fucking irritating. Everyone is so fucking toxic and obnoxious, fake as fuck and judgemental. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`2`**:** I hate most of the kids my age. This fucking sucks. Everyone is a fucking caveman, and sadly when I was younger I got caught up with these kids and fucking lost myself and had an identity crisis. I was acting like a fucking loser, so I seperated myself. Now I hang out with no one and this sucks ass too, I cant find anyone I genuinely relate with anymore. And I guess I havent been able to for a while because Ive realized that Ive been hopping from clique to clique trying to find my fucking place for my whole life, only to realize I dont fit anywhere and I fucking hate everyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`3`**:** Im not trying to sound like im a \"misfit\" or something stupid like that, I just cant relate to anyone around me thats my age. Everyones a judgemental, insecure little bitch and its getting to me. I cant even try and read a book I found in class that I genuinely find interesting without some \"friends\" teasing me about for like 20 minutes. Teasing is funny, but not when these illiterate fucks are making fun of me and grabbing the book and throwing it around for almost a half an hour. I dont get it, what is wrong with these kids.\n\nNow im horny, lonely little shit with no fucking life and no goals or motivations surrounded by troglodytes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dont think im depressed anymore so I probably shouldnt be posting this here but I feel like no one would have cared if I posted somewhere else. I was going to post this on r/offmychest but I think it would have been against their rules. And r/Vent doesnt have as big of a following. Im looking for replies and interesting conversations to have with people who could maybe relate a little bit or just have something interesting to say.",

            "selftext": "I honestly do not know how to keep going. I am just so mentally and physically exhausted each and every day. I go to therapy and take medication but I just don't think any of it is working. How do people just keep going... Everyday I just don't feel like myself anymore. Nothing interests me. The only thing I am doing right now is school and it's actually not going that bad. It is probably the only thing I am good at. I have no social life because I just don't can't. I hate myself for making dumb excuses. My grades are all my have and that won't even matter in the long run because people care about your sociability skills and personality and at the moment, it just feels like I'm this black hole that just is never going to close. I feel like such a giant burden on my friends. \n\nAnyways I did something really stupid the other week, and I think I have just been spiraling downwards ever since. Over a year ago, when I started college, I was sexually assaulted and have really been trying to move on from it, but it just does not seem like it is going to leave my brain anytime soon. I just want to move on but I really do not know how. Living in this city has been so difficult, because he lives so close to me and goes to my school gym. I just don't know what to do. He's been trying to catfish me on Grindr a lot, but I just block him immediately usually. However, last week, I had a lot to drink, ran out of alcohol and did not want to be sober. So, I opened Grindr and saw that he had hit me up again. I told him to cut the crap and asked if he could get me alcohol. He said yes, but I would have to meet him. So, I did. Some stuff happened that I cannot even bring myself to say because I am just so idiotic. I took the alcohol, walked away and just started crying and sitting on the sidewalk. I think I cried for about 2 hours and by the time I got back home it was 5 am. I didn't even snap at him. I didn't confront him. I didn't do anything. How pathetic is that? For a while before this happened, I thought I was actually getting better, but now I feel like I'm just going backwards. I'm just wasting everyone's time. \n\nSorry if this does not belong in this thread, I just needed to let it out. Y'all can delete it if you want. Sorry for wasting yalls time.",

I lost my job, sure, and I really liked my job. But, they closed the site I worked at. That\u2019s out of my control. Even then, my rent for the next month is paid. I have time to find new work. \n\n But, so, why am I like this? Why is it so hard to leave my chair? To step outside? Why does my chest clench at the thought of interacting with people? Why can\u2019t I sleep? Night after night, I\u2019m awake while everyone else is asleep, only collapsing into unconsciousness whenever my body is too physically exhausted to keep me awake any longer. \n\nAnd again, what right do I even have to feel like this? My legs aren\u2019t broken, my relationships aren\u2019t falling apart - even if the thought that my wife would be better off with someone else nags at me. She really tries to understand and help, but I know she doesn\u2019t really get it. \n\nIt\u2019s like a weight on my shoulders, filling my lungs. Suffocating me and sapping my will to do... anything. I sit here at my desk night after night, often just staring at the screen of my computer and not even doing anything. Because I can\u2019t bring myself to. \n\nSo, what do I do?",

Left a bar and am back at my apartment. I\u2019ve never felt so inconsequential. An hour passed before anyone (1 person) knew I was even gone. \n\nThis thought keeps pacing through my head - why am I alive?? There seems to be no reason. It\u2019s painful for me to remember the days in which I was truly happy. The days in which this fucking shadow didn\u2019t haunt me...\n\nI think the only reason I haven\u2019t killed myself yet is the guilt and the fear. Guilt that my death might hurts my family - my little sisters and my mother. Fear that, in killing myself, I will be damned to a hell worse than I currently find myself.\n\nRecently, I find it very hard to believe that there is truly a Heaven or a God - despite such fears I find myself facing about Hell. If there is a God in this world, I would like to ask: Why did you make me the way?? There is something in me that is wrong... why can other people be happy, while I\u2019m left lying awake in bed writing about my sadness, my dread, to strangers?\n\nObjectively, I know that other people - perhaps you, the person reading this - feel the way I do. Sad, alone, desperate. But it\u2019s hard for me to truly acknowledge that others know the darkness I feel, now...\n\nThis feeling has to be damnation.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m writing this, now. I\u2019ve felt this way for a long time. I thought I accepted that I would never truly be happy \u2014 that, one day, I would willingly end my own existence. But here I find myself reaching out. \n\nIf, by chance you actually finished reading this post, thank you. Even if you are completely anonymous, even if my post has been read by no one at all, I will imagine that others have read this and empathized with the way I feel.\n\nGod, I\u2019m twenty-one and already wish that everything was over.\n\nTell me, if one wishes to die... isn\u2019t that same as already being dead? Even if I breathe now, am I truly alive? If I was to cease to be, would my family hate me? Would God?",

            "selftext": "So I\u2019m struggling with depression for like my whole life by now but I\u2019m just at another peak of the misery my life is.. About 1.5 years ago I lost my flat because I couldn\u2019t get any student loan anymore, I moved back to my mother and her husband and took the toll on me for a daily trip of 2.5 hours to and back from college.. Just half a year ago my mothers husband started cheating and one day just disappeared and it all went down. We have to move out completely until the end of the month and it\u2019s quite destroying for my psych because we have no help at all and due to illness my mother is only able to drive a car.. Now we\u2019re in the final stage of moving out and have to get all the furniture brought over, it all just seems so tedious.. I also notice the reason I moved out years ago because I can\u2019t really get along with my mother long term..  We always seem to get started at each other because she doesn\u2019t understand that I really do struggle with my ptsd, depression and aspergers. Well there\u2019s some kinda light at the moment, on between all of the struggle I got to know an awesome girl which I really get along with like no one else before in my life, we both act like having developed stronger feeling but at the same time just both ended up with our problems beside of that. It\u2019s like we won\u2019t tell our feelings because being too afraid to hurt each other somehow based on our past experiences. She told me she doesn\u2019t want to treat me unfair because there\u2019s this one person which is really toxic for her but she can\u2019t get away from him, she had feelings for him years ago and they had been like best friends for years but she  just wants to get her distance from this person, which also seems to be really manipulative. Now in this week we\u2019re apart from each other and I noticed she struggles a lot. I\u2019m just in a big state of worrying and being totally stressed out by moving out. I really don\u2019t know what I could do at the moment, I just try to somehow make it through but it always feels like just having a breakdown the next moment..",

I kept asking to be put into normal classes and they eventually did but only with a helper teacher in all of them that essentially prevented me from forming any meaningful friendships. I was the kid that everyone made fun of because of it. After a few years of the bullying, I started skipping school. I skipped so much that I had to go to court and a bunch of legal stuff. They took me to therapists, psychiatrists, and counselors but nothing ever helped me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even know what my GPA is and they still won't give me my diploma for graduating. I'm stuck working in an awful fast food job that genuinely makes me want to kill myself because of how stressful it is. My parents think I'm a failure and have basically shut me out of their lives. My co-workers all think I'm useless and constantly make fun of me. My few friends that I do have NEVER go out of their way to include me in anything or even check in on me at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to kill myself on the off-chance that I can start life over again as someone else that matters.",

            "selftext": "I was lucky to get into a university. I was lucky that my application process was just an interview instead of the traditional essay and all. I was lucky to get a scholarship. And I think I\u2019m blowing it. \n\nToday was the last day of freshman year. I should be stoked. Instead I walked out of my final exam not feeling much of anything at all. From the very beginning I should have seen this coming. I started the year with a rare feeling of optimism; \u201cthis won\u2019t be like high school, this is different!\u201d. Boy was I wrong. \n\nI have been feeling depressed for a long time, at least since I was 11 or 12. I have been properly diagnosed with anxiety and major depression for a couple years now. I am not nor have I ever been medicated. Since freshman year of high school I have had no ambition to succeed in any capacity because I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it past 18. In high school, I barely showed up. I half assed my work and didn\u2019t study for anything. I spent a lot of my time alone in my room doing nothing. Here I am now, over 18 with no idea what I\u2019m doing. I made the bold decision to double major with a minor even though I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it, like an idiot. And it\u2019s like high school all over again. I stopped going to class about a week in because I was too  mentally exhausted to get myself out of bed in the morning. I got involved with clubs and things at school and I\u2019m in charge of a lot of things there for the next year and I don\u2019t even know if I can handle it. I don\u2019t have any genuine friends because I can\u2019t relate to anyone there. I eat alone, I go to class alone, and I go home to be alone. It\u2019s just the same as high school except harder. \n\nMy family have high expectations for me because they think I\u2019m smart. I think I\u2019m smart too in certain subjects but I just can\u2019t retain information anymore so it doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t focus and I procrastinate too. I haven\u2019t had a major depressive episode in a while so I\u2019ve been able to do some moderate studying and get most of my work done on time but sometimes I have no will to go to my desk and write my French paper. This results in D work which I don\u2019t care about because \u201cI can bring this up\u201d. Then I do so bad on my exams that it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI did volunteer work outside of school for the first two months of this year while also working on a show in my college which lasted for four. This time was stressful and took away from my schoolwork but it kept me so busy that I didn\u2019t think about how sad I was. It\u2019s difficult for me to just focus on school because schoolwork puts such immense pressure on me to succeed that I don\u2019t even want to try because I\u2019m so afraid to fail. Which is a bad thought process but that\u2019s all I know. \n\nI failed exam after exam. I blew paper after paper. I have a 3.1 (high enough to keep my scholarship by .3) but after these finals go through I KNOW it\u2019s gonna plummet. This is such a big chance for me and I\u2019m blowing it! And I don\u2019t even care. \n\nI feel so apathetic towards everyone and everything. I\u2019m at an all time low. I have no interest in anything these other kids do. I don\u2019t want to date or have friends or participate in school. I don\u2019t want to eat with people in the dining hall or go with them to games. I don\u2019t want to study and I don\u2019t want to put effort into anything I do. But at the same time it gives me such bad anxiety. \n\nWhich brings me to my main point. I walked out of all three of my exams feeling low. Today I finished French and immediately was hit with regret. I wasted an entire year of college. I did so poorly that I don\u2019t know how I could salvage it. Obviously I\u2019m not failing with a .2 GPA and I\u2019m not getting kicked out but I\u2019m doing below average and it really fucking sucks. For a kid like me who\u2019s been waiting years for this kind of freedom, this kind of chance to do whatever I want in life, not being able to achieve it because of some stupid ass illness I never asked for really just shatters me. All I wanted was a normal college experience and it was just too much to ask for. \n\nAnyone else with a similar experience? As shitty as it is I\u2019d like to know I\u2019m not alone. I get it\u2019s trivial when other people have bigger problems but this on top of everything else in my life is really just killing me.",

But seriously I googled this and found like 2 people on the internet who even partially wish for amnesia, and it\u2019s all for reasons like \u201cI did something embarassing and want to forget this one event.\u201d \n\n\nTragic backstory.doc:\n\nTo say my childhood was \u201ctraumatic\u201d would be an understatement. It was fucking awful. I got hit with a severe autoimmune disorder when I was 7 that basically ended my normal childhood. Super sick all the time, had to be pulled from school. This disorder is tied to psychological effects so I also develop a case of OCD so severe they had trouble diagnosing it. Couldn\u2019t function at all. This led to extreme depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts... all at the age of 7. I was so unable to be around people because I could get sick and die (plus I was in a state of basically 24/7 panic attack) that I was totally isolated and had to be home alone all the time. Led to a lot of resentment from my mom who ended her career to take care of me. \n\nThen when I was 10-11 and recovering somewhat I got hit with Lyme disease which went uncaught &amp; got severe. Was basically in and out of the hospital getting transfusions for years and had to fly around the country for unheard of treatments. When I was 14 I was finally well ish enough to go back to school, but I had to go to a private school so I\u2019d be around less people (aka couldn\u2019t get sick as easily). Got bullied relentlessly because socially I had the experience of a 7 year old plus learning the rest of my social skills from the Internet (the only social thing I could have since I couldn\u2019t really have IRL friends).\n\nActual post time:\n\nI feel like I\u2019m so fucked up mentally. I\u2019m a sophomore in college now and people think I\u2019m super responsible from the outside (turns out elite schools eat up a terrible childhood) but I\u2019m actually non-functioning. I\u2019m in therapy and it just feels like there\u2019s so much trauma that I\u2019ll never be able to recover and move on with my life. I feel physically incapable of moving on from my past. Although i have opportunities i can\u2019t take them because my mental state is so awful. I hate everyone i meet, i push people away, i have terrible executive dysfunction, etc. I really wish every single day of my life that I could get amnesia. I know amnesia isn\u2019t easy but at least I could start over from scratch without so much trauma.\n\nDoes anyone else here, whether or not you\u2019ve had an awful past, wish for the same thing? Seriously I would give up everything I have just to forget my whole life. And I\u2019d hope no one I know would tell me about anything bad &amp; would pretend my \u201coutward appearance\u201d that I present to strangers is how I really was.",

No one knows about that, not even my family. This \u201cfriend\u201d of mine was my classmate and former friend since last year. We used to create banter and laugh a lot and hung out sometimes after sch. Things were amazing back then. Everything was fine. I looked forward to sch everyday.\n\nHowever, this year, everything changed.\n\nI started showing symptoms of depression. I guess it was a manifestation of guilt, anxiety, stress and a lot of other shit that I can\u2019t figure out in my life up till now. I really didn\u2019t mean to drift away from him, I still want us to remain as friends but I just can\u2019t keep up the convo and I feel like we have a strong clash of very different personalities. He used to goof around in class and throw playground insults at other ppl &amp; mimic others\u2019 voices and shit like that, which kinda _annoyed_ me \u2014a lot. Every time I get depressed again and again is because he started joking around with ppl but not with me anymore. He doesn\u2019t even ask me out for lunch nor ask me about my feelings even tho he knows i\u2019m down. I wish he did. I wish I could trust him to tell him my emotions, and how i\u2019m struggling so badly, but I couldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t even strike a normal convo with him anymore. Yes I\u2019ve drifted apart from him and isolate myself from the rest of the world. Yet he never once asked me about my feelings even tho I want to spill them out to him so badly, but I didn\u2019t have the courage to. I lost my confidence. I became socially withdrawn. I get panic attacks easily. I still do. \n\nToday, I guess we\u2019ve drifted apart for so long he finally said \u201cfuck you\u201d to me. He thought I was a fake friend. I guess I was, even though I cared about him but couldn\u2019t prove it to him. I\u2019ve been crying for the past few days but this one really hit me in the core. It\u2019s like someone threw acid at my face. idk how to react with this. All my pent out emotions just spilled out and I felt heartbroken. Very, very heartbroken.\n\nToday, I guess I\u2019ve had enough. Maybe we weren\u2019t fit as friends for each other. I\u2019ve completely lost my trust in him and I guess I had to confide my feelings elsewhere. I guess today\u2019s the day we have officially severed our ties.",

I\u2019m successul academically but that\u2019s it. Outside of school I\u2019m a complete dumbass. I\u2019m reminded of this constantly. I can\u2019t articulate anything in conversation, I don\u2019t learn from mistakes, I have the critical thinking skills of a 4 year old, etc. I have a job waiting tables and I\u2019m horrible at it to the point where the restaurant is losing business because of how terrible and awkward I am. I have no skills whatsoever. I\u2019ve failed at everything I\u2019ve done. Even video games that I have spent over a thousand hours playing I still suck at. My social skills are poor to the point where people think I\u2019m autistic. I can\u2019t manage my emotions at all. I\u2019m actually worthless. I don\u2019t have a single friend and it seems that everywhere I go people hate me. I still get bullied in college sometimes and I\u2019m 21 years old. Even my family sits around the dinner table and bullies me when we\u2019re all together. I haven\u2019t gotten a birthday present in 5 or 6 years. In a recent conversation with my mom she admitted to me that when I came to her feeling worthless before that I was right and she just didn\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t see any point in continuing my life. I can\u2019t imagine people showing up to my funeral to say anything kind at all. I\u2019m gonna die like my uncle where people just talked shit about him over his grave.",

I just wish I felt like I belonged somewhere...anywhere. I'm homesick for a home I don't even know. I've felt this way all 22 years of my life, and I really don't look forward to feeling this way for the remainder of my life. \n\nI finally was able to try out this young adult support group a while back and really enjoyed being surrounded by my peers. But I couldn't go to any future sessions because one of my classes overlapped with the time. Now I'm really sad because I liked my fellow group members and was looking forward to making some friends as I currently don't have any irl friends. \n\nI just feel very lonely, isolated, tired, behind, and my apathy and suicidal thoughts are coming back strong. I want to be passionate about things, go out, have fun with friends, laugh, smile, and just *live*. I've been wanting to try meetup for a while too, it's just, I feel like a total loser and am super self-conscious. I feel like I'd just end up feeling worse. Idk. I wish I knew someone who felt the same way I did and could relate to me. Maybe I wouldn't feel so completely and utterly alone. \n\nFuck, I just want to be held. It's pathetic I haven't hugged a non-family member in over 3 years.  Actually, recently I had to do an assignment where I had to be blindfolded and my partner linked arms with me to help with guiding and preventing me from walking into a pole or wall lol. It felt so nice...fuck, physical touch is powerful stuff. Doesn't help that one my classmates is jelly and has been cold to me because she has a crush on my partner. I thought she just hated me, but now I understand a bit. Still though, it's not my fault he keeps asking me to be his partner. \n\nIdk why I'm rambling. I need to get out of my head more often. I hope I can make a relatable friend soon. I can't keep living like this. I don't want to.",

            "selftext": "For a little backstory I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my sophomore year, and while I was doing well for the first 3 years, once I got to college it all started going down hill when I started to really realize how terrible I am at just doing things like homework, laundry, and cleaning. I\u2019ve been on Citalopram and I\u2019m consistent with it.   \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a mental illness related thing or not, but I just want to find someone who understands. I really struggle with doing anything but lay in bed all day and play video games or watch movies and stuff. And it kills me and makes me feel all tight in the chest all the time, so even when I\u2019m doing enjoyable things I\u2019m not completely there because I\u2019m in my mind going \u201cI should be doing this. I should be doing this.\u201d \n\nBut also, it\u2019s always been like this, even when I felt better with my depression and everything. In high school, however, I did my work (very last minute) because if I didn\u2019t I would get direct consequences and shame. But now, in college, I get none of that so there\u2019s nothing stopping me. \n\nI\u2019m scared that this isn\u2019t something I can change. What if this is who I am? What if I can never change it and fail out and I\u2019m unable to do the things in life that I want to do? What if I\u2019m useless? My parents are successful teachers, my older sister just got into graduate school, my friends and younger sister have 4.0 gpa\u2019s, and my girlfriend is working hard towards a nursing and I\u2019m stuck here, alone, unable to move my ass for 2 more weeks until the end of the year. It\u2019s seems like everyone is able to do what they want/need to do. Except me. \n\nI asked my friend today (while spiraling) how she did things like have a 4.0 and exercise and everything and she said \u201chard work and determination\u201d and \u201cyou just need to find something you\u2019re passionate about\u201d as if I hadn\u2019t already tried that. I know she\u2019s only trying to help but it just made me frustrated bc I feel motivated. I feel passionate (for at least one of my classes) and yet. I\u2019m still doing nothing except lay in bed and panic. \n\nThe anxiety about overdue and due homework makes me spiral into having bad thoughts about myself. Like maybe I should just stop. \n\nDoes anyone else do this? Did you figure out a way to actually get up and do stuff?? I just need people to talk to that understand that it\u2019s not as easy as \u201cfinding something I feel passionate about\u201d\n\nEveryone keeps saying \u201cjust three more weeks\u201d (until the end of the semester) but I don\u2019t know if I can make it.",

Anyway, when I went there, it was raining really hard and there was a person collapsed on the ground right in front of the building's doors. They were like that when I got there. Not sure how long they were there for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was dark because of how late it was, so I couldn't discern much about the person on the ground, except that they were motionless and had a push thing with wheels (not sure what you call it), so I'm assuming they were elderly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't know what to do, so I just drove around them and went to the drive-thru, which had a long wait time despite only having one person in front of me. I think it's because the Taco Bell employees were concentrating on figuring out what to do about the situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked back at the person even though I was farther along in the drive-thru line, and wondered if I should do anything about it. It felt kind of surreal and I wasn't sure what to do. So I didn't help at all. I thought that maybe I could have gotten the umbrella out of my trunk or helped move them inside so they wouldn't be in the rain, but I didn't do any of that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, one of the Taco Bell employees came out and looked at the person, then went back inside. I think that's when they called 911. They came out and went back inside a couple more times, looking at the person on the ground. Maybe they asked if they were okay or something, but it was far enough away and the rain was loud enough that I wouldn't have been able to hear anything even if they were talking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen an ambulance and a cop car arrived, and I tried to look away because I felt like they were being helped and it's none of my business so I should respect their privacy and all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it was an old person who either got seriously injured or possibly died, collapsed on the ground, and I didn't do anything about it. I feel bad. I wish I had done something. I didn't even call 911 even though I had my phone with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still got the food afterward but I felt kind of selfish about it, because here this person was, motionless on the ground near the entrance, in the rain, and all I cared about was my food. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm thinking about all the things I could have done instead, and how if I acted differently, there might have been a different outcome.",

I have been skipping school for almost 3 weeks now, and im doing it again tomorrow, and no matter how much i beg myself to go, i never manage to get myself out of bed and to attend classes, that would actually get me talking to people and perhaps make me get better; and, to makes thing worse, my family is starting to hate me for, in their eyes, becoming a burden. \n\nBut the real nail in the coffing, that made me post this is that, in my country, theres a really long holiday coming up. When i realized this, i literally screamed and broke into tears, because i know that i havent seen anyone outside of my family for so long, and now i cant even try and talk to people even if i want to. I have no one to ask to hang out, im completely fucking alone, and for the next 6 days, i can already feel myself not showering, waking up late feeling guilty, feeling this crushing loneliness, rotting myself up and basically making myself so fucking ugly i wont be able to recover when classes come back. I have no one to be good looking for, *NO ONE* will see me, so why bother? \n\nIt aches in my chest that i can only play games while time wastes away, and everyone else has fun hanging out with their friends and going to parties. I know ill get bored of it -  hell, im already fucking bored of it. I feel like a ghost, and being alone is all the confirmation my mind needs to be sure that i indeed am one. And i dont know how much i can take, because ive already ahd a suicide attempt because of this a couple months ago, and i honestly dont know if im better, or if ill just do the same provided the same lonely conditions. Then again, at least i dont have to worry too much about succeding in killing myself, cause honestly, as any ghost, i feel i died a long fucking time ago",

I\u2019ve been going to therapy for the past 6 months and I would like to know how you decide whether it\u2019s time to get a new psychologist or stop therapy altogether. I\u2019ve been on and off different medications and my most recent experience has been a bad one. However, my doctors wanted me to stay on my meds for the full month despite me telling them about some serious side effects I was experiencing. My mom  told me something I didn\u2019t want to hear which was that therapy was pointless because she hasn\u2019t noticed a difference in my behavior. It\u2019s very difficult for me to talk with my family about these kind of things because I was never taken seriously. I\u2019m probably at one of the lowest points in my life right now and I want to know what are some good qualities to look for in a psychologist. I have an appointment tomorrow and everyone is making feel bad about it because they think I should just stop going altogether.",

I dropped out of my high school a while ago and I started doing it online instead because I was being treated badly and doing it online is easier for me. My sister has many medical conditions and whenever she gets a job they treat her so bad and pay her such a little amount to the point that she is forced to quit or else she will have a mental breakdown. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad left me a long time ago so the only people who can bring money into the house is my mom and my sister and my sister has had really bad luck with that. My life feels like the definition of Murphy's law. I have suicidal thoughts all the time and I really don't know what to do anymore since my life currently is a never-ending loop of poverty and homelessness. I'm still very young so there is not much I can really do in terms of bringing in money (I'm 16).",

She asked about them this week - I told her I would have them in by tonight.  Still no drafts.  The final draft of the entire paper is due this weekend. I am confident I will get the entire thing done, but I feel bad for not keeping my word about submitting the rough drafts.  I have requested to have a phone conversation tomorrow.  Should I let me professor what has been going on with my mental health?  I don't want her to think it's just an excuse, especially because I've completed discussion posts and journal posts on time (though those are easier).  \n\nI am on medication and just saw my psychiatrist today to increase my dosage.

I just had the most painful argument with my boyfriend of almost 4 years about my battle with depression and anxiety. \n\nThe last thing I ever want to do is burden my family and loved ones with my issues, or make them think I am incapable of taking care of myself. I am so afraid of people thinking there is something \u201cwrong\u201d with me, and absolutely refuse to bring anyone down with me. My family is also not very supportive when it comes to things like this.. and I don\u2019t have many friends... So I keep everything to myself for the most part, have been trying to figure it out on my own. and I\u2019ve been pushing through each and every day. \n\nMy boyfriend is the love of my life. He is a great man, we talk about our future together, and we have never had any issues. He helps me more than he knows, and he means everything to me. However, I\u2019ve mentioned my anxiety and depression in the past and his response was rather confused and standoffish, which threw me off, so I never mentioned it again, fearing he\u2019d view me differently. \n\nI\u2019ve held it in for so long and I just really needed his support tonight. My anxiety has been crippling and affecting my work performance, which has in turn given me more anxiety and depression, so we had a talk last week about it that went well, he said he understood and he was here to support me while I get help and get these issues resolved. \n\nWell tonight it was brought up again, and I believe everything he\u2019s ever been holding in about me came out. I was told to get my shit together. That I\u2019m weak and lazy. That he gets anxious too but it\u2019s still no excuse, that I should be working just as hard as him. That I\u2019m adding to his plate. He doesn\u2019t understand how I can be anxious and depressed over nothing, I need to suck it up and get over it...  \n\nI\u2019ve heard it all from everyone before, I know. But I just feel like such a pathetic hopeless piece of shit right now because it came from someone I love, and someone I thought understood the most. It\u2019s just enough to set me to my lowest point, and I don\u2019t know what to do with myself right now. I guess I\u2019m writing all this as a cry for help. I just want to know I\u2019m not crazy. I\u2019m not alone out there.",

This has triggered the same feelings and patterns as my breakdown. The worst bit is my depression manifests physically in very intense ways. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep my mind races so much even when i\u2019m distracting myself with music or TV. I feel sick constantly (a big part of my anxiety is that I will be sick at any moment). I can\u2019t eat as a result even though i\u2019m starving. I also ache and shiver quite violently at times so i\u2019ve spent most of the past few days in bed.\n\nThis is identical to my last breakdown though I know what to expect a bit more. This doesn\u2019t stop it from being incredibly scary. I am also coming of my meds at the minute (50g of Sertraline) which makes me dizzy and out of it.\n\nI am wondering if anyone has advice and/or similar experience. In the past I have gone and lived with my parents but they now live abroad. I can potentially ask friends to stay at theirs but I am not sure somewhere totally unfamiliar would be good for me right now.\n\nMy mental state is not awful at the minute. I believe I have value and life is worth living. However, I know from past experience as my physical condition gets worse my mental state follows.",

I hate depression and how I feel, but I mentally cant put any effort into my recovery. I feel like I\u2019m getting comfort from my own pain.\n\nI just got back from a rehab. Who goes to rehab at 14? I don\u2019t want to stay sober, no matter how much I convince myself I want to. If I stayed sober, I wouldn\u2019t have to go through losing my freedom again and going back to rehab. But drugs make me feel happy and normal, and I don\u2019t have to put any effort in. Even when I was addicted it gave me something to do.\n\nI don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to. People are there for me and would be so happy if I talked to them, but I can\u2019t. I just want to be left alone. I\u2019ve had therapists, but I don\u2019t tell them my real feelings because I don\u2019t want them to take me back to the hospital. I always pretend to be happy. My parents believe me. I\u2019m starting IOP tomorrow. Let\u2019s see how quickly I can graduate by bullshitting through it. \n\nI don\u2019t thinking I\u2019m going to last long.",

Pretty much the only thing that makes me somewhat happy at this point is my job. I dread coming to my apartment every night because I know I\u2019m gonna cry for hours in my chamber of secrets lookin apartment. I\u2019ve had some history of self harm and drugs and I\u2019ve started going back in the habit again. \n\nBut I really don\u2019t wanna slip back into being that person, especially when I\u2019m so close to graduating college. So thinking about all this, I\u2019ve made the decision to move back to my hometown and be close to my family for a little bit, find a job there and work. Meanwhile prepare for my MBA and get another employer recommendation while I\u2019m at it. \n\nAnyways, I was talking to one of my closest and oldest my friends from  middle to high school and still today. And I kinda told him all this and while broke down into tears while saying it. I basically told him everything. At the end told me, **\u201dWell that\u2019s not the person I know. Be a man and stop all this. \u201c**",

            "selftext": "This year, after being dignosed with Major depressive disorder with psychotic tendencies and also general anxiety/extreme social anxiety, this had been one of my biggest challenges. As I'm fixing myself and focusing on me and what I need in life, there's still this feeling inside of me that dies a little when I see or watch couple's get engaged/married so incredibly, irrevocably inlove. I was married once at 18; ended it due to the person being an addict and self absorbed. Was also engaged years later only to have that person cheat on me multiple times, along with when my mother died. I swore off marriage after that. But when I see friends, family, or even just people online or tv get engaged...my heart jumps to my throat and I die a little each times, even though I'm so happy for them... I want a love. A love that understand my disorder. A love that understands who I am, and is supportive. A love that makes me feel like I'm the sun to their solar system. A love of someone who let's me know everything will be ok, even without words. But I also feel deep down inside that being lonely fits me and is what is written in my prophecy. I've had long term relationship since the engagement, but they never felt nor reached the level of \"You're who I want forever, no matter what may come.\" This dynamic really messed with me and makes me feel so many different feelings. I know my self issues and ghosts of events past have an affect on my current process and in the long run are the least I should worry for. But at the same time being the only one in my friend group who hasn't found someone to decide I'm worth it messes with me. My self growth is going pretty steady, but again, I need and thrive on love. A pure love of someone who just loves me as me. Accepts and understands. And wants me over anything else. Despite my proven and psychological downfalls. Being diagnosed has opened and  twisted life more than before I knew what was wrong.",

It hurts so much that it got physical, my heart hurts all time, I\u2019m nauseous and with headaches all the time. I want to hurt myself so bad, and I do. I do it and it\u2019s my girlfriend the only one who tries to calm me down but it\u2019s so damn unfair to her, I\u2019m so toxic, she doesn\u2019t deserve someone like me.

I feel a little better when my colleague reassured that its alright and it happens to her sometimes too. But still i feel terrible cos in my culture, crying is seen as a sign of weakness as well and it's really quite disruptive at work esp if it appears out the blue\n\nKind of wondering how common is this in your region / country you live in, is it a socially acceptable thing?",

I'm already depressed as is but when I drink I often fantasize about death and how it would be so much better than living and it gets to the point I get so excited about death even though I know I never could do it.\n\nI applied for my gun license recently because I thought if I had the lethal option there instead of actually cutting or jumping off a bridge or hanging myself etc... I figured it'd be quicker with a gun.\n\nI'm honestly drunk right now and don't know if it's something I'd ever do. I mean whether I'm sober or drunk I know I hate my fucking life.\n\nI find it easier to live knowing that I have the option to end my life if things get too bad.

She had a tendency to switch my meds on me, and since i was a minor, i couldnt do anything.  I moved out at 18, and had to find a new doctor.  My first meeting with this new doctor, my mom again requested to change my meds, after i had already been doing well on prozac for a few years in high school.  I was still a minor (19 is the age of adulthood in my state) and again couldnt do anything about it. This was 2 years ago. I took the meds for a few days, said fuck it, and stopped.  I didnt tell anyone, and lied to my doctor everytime i went in for a checkup.\nYesterday, i was completely honest with my doctor. Now that im 21, my mom has no say on my medications. I switched back to prozac. It felt good being open and honest, i dont have to hide anymore and suffer in silence.",

I met my gf working at Sonic she was very shy at first but as days passed we got closer and i asked her on a date and everything went great,she\u2019s a great gf who is always there to help me,we\u2019ve been dating for almost a year and she\u2019s literally the only thing that makes me happy. I was going to college and used it as an excuse to move in to dorms and be away from my mom. So I don\u2019t have to deal with her shit every single day,months passed and i came back from college but stayed with my gf,my mom didn\u2019t like it but i could care less. I also have to say that i have this tendency to be very self destructive and just blame everything on me and bring myself down and sometimes that brings arguments with my gf,I\u2019ve been doing it more often and idk why i try to be as happy and kind to her as possible but i just get drowned with negative emotions. So one night i kind of saw her messages cause i thought she was cheating on me even tho she didn\u2019t so I went through her fb and saw some messages with her bff and my said she was getting tired of me to the point she doesn\u2019t want to be with me anymore and that completely just shattered me and I\u2019ve been trying to hide my emotions from it but I\u2019m getting close to my boiling point. (I know that it\u2019s wrong to check your partners phone) what should i do? Because if she leaves me I\u2019ll definitely go down the suicide path and just get it over with.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m an 18 M and for the last 7 years or so I\u2019ve struggled with suicidal thoughts. It\u2019s started as a dream where my wrists were slit but I wasn\u2019t old enough to understand it. I woke up crying asking my mom why my wrists were bleeding. She told me to think of family and go back to bed as it was a school night. About 2 months later, I had another dream where I had a gun to my head and as I pulled the trigger I woke up with the worst headache I had ever experienced at the time. I figured it was a bad dream and tried to go back to bed. After that night, I don\u2019t remember a night where I didn\u2019t silently cry until I passed out until my freshman year of high school. Within that time frame, my mind started to shift from dreams once a week to almost nonstop thoughts of my funeral, a plethora of ways to commit, and the aftershock of what my death would be. My junior year, I enlisted in the US Army. I figured it would be a way to start over and be trained to be mentally tough. But my thoughts got worse and worse. The worst they had ever been. I called my ex girlfriend at the time and got no answer and gave up. I was found an old pocketknife, took out the knife and sat there with three suicide notes. I then got a call from my ex asking if I was okay because I didn\u2019t generally call her unless I really needed her especially late at night. I opened up to her about my mental health and if she didn\u2019t stay on the phone with me until I passed out, I fully believe I wouldn\u2019t be here. The next morning, my mom came in my room and woke me up. Asking me where the notes were and why I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone. I told her that day I wanted t get help. She told me it would ruin my chances with the Army so I decided to not go. Fast forward to my senior year, I\u2019m back with my ex girlfriend. I invested myself so much into her that when my ship date arrived, I said my goodbyes and made my way to the hotel. At the hotel, my head started spinning and I couldn\u2019t stop shaking and crying. I kept looking around the room to try and ground myself and get my s*** together. I saw started listing things (mentally) that I could physically feel with my hands and describe the textures. As soon as I grabbed a glass that was in my room, I instantly blacked out. Last thing I remember from that night was the thought of throwing the glass on the ground to break it and slit my wrists. I woke up the next morning, started my day by taking a shower. But I didn\u2019t feel in control of anything I did or thought as if I\u2019m a trance like state. I hop in the shower and next thing I know, I\u2019m banging my head as hard as I can on the wall. My roommate came in and stopped me and I \u2018woke up\u2019. I decided to tell MEPS that I was not ready to leave and went that whole day trying to figure out why I did that. After 12 hours of them trying to convince me that I was ready, I finally got to go home. I decided to check myself into a mental hospital as I pretty much threw away my dream job. I get there, go through the process, get my room and as soon as I was alone, I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I got out in three days after with the meds I needed. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2, anxiety and insomnia. I moved in with my grandma (doesn\u2019t believe) and she told me that I have no reason to kill myself and didn\u2019t take me to my therapy sessions so I could get my meds. Two months later, my girlfriend left me. I was crushed. I did everything I possibly could to try and move on. Deleted every picture, the usual break up stuff but then I turned to alcohol and weed when she wouldn\u2019t leave my head. I drowned myself every night in alcohol until two weeks ago. I felt and still feel like I lost everything I ever wanted and needed. I haven\u2019t had a drink in two weeks but I still smoke. I\u2019m unmedicated now and struggle every day to find a reason to continue. I feel like I\u2019m only here because I want to make my family happy. But now it\u2019s turning into, I\u2019m not happy, how could I possibly make others happy? I don\u2019t believe my family cares for me anymore even though they say they do. My mom talks to my ex almost everyday and it\u2019s been 6 months since we broke up. I see my mom\u2019s comments on her Facebook status\u2019 almost every day and I don\u2019t even get a text from my mom checking up on me. She invited her to my sisters birthday that she knew I was gonna be at. It just feels like she could care less how I feel. I\u2019m just so lost on my next steps in life and I\u2019m no longer motivated to even find work. I\u2019m running out of hope and I just need support and help with how to cope.\n\nI apologize as this is kind of all over the place, if there is any questions, I\u2019ll try to answer them the best I can. \n\nThank you for anything you think will help\u2764\ufe0f",

            "selftext": "Hey, I made a sort of secondary account to rant a little bit, things haven't been going too well. I think it might help to just get all of it out.\n\nJust to paint a picture, 17/m/skinny af, I live in a predominantly conservative area where mental health is more of a joke than anything.\n\n \\^(just gonna be typing as I think of stuff)\n\nAs far as I remember, I've always wanted to die. I remember always walking into the store with my mum asking if she could kill me (me being about 7 and not understanding the legal, let alone, moral ramifications of this), she didn't really think too much of it, as I didn't understand a whole lot about death at age 7. It wasn't like I was abused or something, I just found it easier (and still do) to die instead of going to the store, going to school, or whatever. This also came with recurring paranoia, I would (and still do) believe that: People always talk about me behind my back and secretly hate me, I was being spied on by my parents, stared at through windows when I wasn't looking, and that people can read my thoughts. I know it isn't very rational, but its an uncontrollable aspect of my life that I always feel. These things sort of stayed until about 9th grade, then they got substantially worse. \n\nI wasn't really someone who understood social situations very well, so I was naturally put in the back of the friend group. I started to develop suicidal tendencies, always thinking: \"why spend 6 hours being miserable when I could just off myself\"? This wasn't much of a time where it was acceptable to talk about suicidal thoughts with male friends, so I didn't. I had just made friends with a girl, but I didn't really think she cared for me all that much as a result of my social ineptitude. We did become very good friends that year though, we can just call her N. \n\n10th grade soon crept around; same shit different day, but my mental health was deteriorating.\n\n11th grade was very bad, I hadn't seen any specialists for mental health and it was (you guessed it) getting worse. I had never been the type of person to ask or tell when it came to problems. N would always ask me what was wrong, and I would always respond with \"I'm tired\" or some half-assed lie. She never pressed me about it further, not because she didn't care, but because she couldn't prove me wrong. Around December (last year), something happened that had caused my thoughts to spiral out of control, and on more than one occasion I would have hanged myself had I not been scared of what my parents or N would think. Needless to say, I was a mental wreck. Bear in mind that my friend group was, and still is, very disconnected with each other's emotions. One of my friends would tell me to kill myself and get it over with; he either didn't know or didn't care about how I was feeling. I don't hold it against him, that's how we joke around. I was absolutely miserable. At one point over the summer, N asked me to go to her birthday party; she was going to head out to a cabin and smoke pot with her friend and Boyfriend. I politely declined, as I didn't think that she really cared, I just thought she was using me. Irrational, I know. I blocked her at some point, not because I hated her; I love her, she's my best friend. I blocked her because I didn't think it was healthy for either of us to talk, and I had hoped that we would just kind of fade out. That didn't happen.\n\n12th grade was (is, 4 more weeks) somehow even worse, although I was more established in my social circle at this point. The thing about people talking about me behind my back is still true, I just can't shake it. Things were normal, I had still felt viciously suicidal, but it wasn't nearly as bad as before. One night, I downed a Four Loko while talking to some IRL and internet friends over Discord. I guess my body didn't like that because I started having a panic attack. I just felt so defenseless and scared for no reason, I no longer felt sad or anything, just pure fear. Then my friend (call him O) came over at 12AM with some water and goldfish. I broke down crying while hugging him, because for the first time in many years I had truly felt like someone cared about me; cared about me enough to go out of their way to bring me water and snacks at 12 at night. I asked him if he could keep a secret, and when he said yes, I had told him everything about how I was feeling. Another 10 or so minutes of crying and he had to leave, but that's a night I'll never forget. The second person I told was N, about a few weeks later. I had been avoiding her prior because I felt like separating from her was a good idea for the both of us. I understand that this was wrong, but it seemed right at the time. She had asked me what was wrong, and I had once again told her \"I'm tired\" or something. For some reason, she wasn't having any of it and demanded to know why I was down. Her reasoning was that she tells me everything, but I don't tell her anything. So, I decided to pull out some paper, and write down how I felt like killing myself every day for the past few years. She was excited to know, but when she actually read the note, she started to tear up. I had since then unblocked her, so she was free to message me whenever. We were still in school, so she didn't cry, but I could tell that she wanted to. We're very close now, but I can't bring myself to tell her that I don't want a future for some reason. I think its because she is always so positive, and I don't want to make her cry or worry about me. I just want her to forget about me and move on, which will ideally happen in about 4 weeks when we graduate. I told my mother a week after, but we haven't brought it up since.\n\nI'm tired of lying about everything. I give N whatever I can because she needs it more than I do, even though she doesn't want anything. I told her that I hate chocolate and most sweets so she'll take what I give her. I'm tired of always telling everyone that I'm \"just tired\" or whatever. I just want them to understand how I feel and let me die alone. I don't help; I don't want therapy, and I certainly don't want friends because that's just more people that I'll make sad if I kill myself. I think I might be developing a dependency on alcohol; I don't have fun anymore, I haven't had fun with much since the start of this year and that includes alcohol. N is going to college, same with most of my friends. I don't want to talk to people anymore, I just want to die, but I can't because that will just make things worse for everybody else. I've tried writing my feelings out, I've tried drawing them, it doesn't matter. I just want the pain to stop, I want the constant feeling of being judged to stop, I want to stop breathing without anybody giving a shit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the end of my rant I guess. On a funnier note, I was going to grab my dad's shotgun about a month ago; I was going to look at it and see how I felt. If I felt like dying in that moment, then i would have pulled the trigger. I went to go get it from under the bed, but there was no shotgun. All I found was a pink dildo. That's something I want to forget, but wont. Goodnight Reddit.",

            "selftext": "I've been in post-grad limbo, graduated 10 months ago and still can't get hired. Notice I don't say \"can't find a job\" because I have found many many jobs. I've applied to over a hundred and I've gotten several face-to face interviews and even more phone interviews. Every time its the same. Rejection. And I can't take it anymore. And after every rejection the voice inside my head that says \"you're trash. You're not good enough. HA you really thought they would want to hire *you* after hearing you speak?\" just gets louder and meaner. \n\nI really just want to take a break from job searching. Maybe I'm just not cut out for the \"real world\" and a \"real career.\" I want to just pick up and move to the mountains and work on a farm through WWOOF and just try to make it up there. I've been living with my parents and disabled brother in my small hometown. The people I've talked to think I should go back to this unrelated summer job I did two years ago, but for me, that is like taking a step backwards. Always forward, never backwards, right? \n\nI've been really struggling lately. I feel like my depression is slowly eating me away. I feel like I'm becoming more awkward, more anxious, more introverted. Like last week, I went to Easter Sunday church with my family and just lost it at the end. I can't explain, I just got really overwhelmed from the crowd and everyone looking so perfect and happy and comparing myself to them and feeling so inadequate. I've gotten these types of feelings before but it's *never* been as bad as it is now. I feel like all the negative things about me have gotten 10x worse since I've been struggling. I feel like its eating away all the good things about me and leaving only the ugly things. All the work I did in college, including the work I put in my mental and social health, are being erased. Every day is a battle with myself and this depression is like a snake wrapped around my neck.\n\nI'm not asking for job searching advice. Yes, I'm using my contacts. Yes, I've had my resume and cover letter critiqued. Yes, I'm trying my best. I'm just looking for someone who understands and someone who can maybe help me see some brighter side. Or tell me what to do. I don't know. I can't take feeling like this anymore.",

I randomly left work, chexked in into a hotel, didn't tell anyone where I was for two days, eventually after some hospitalizations, my boyfriend and his family were able to pay for me to go to treatment in another state. This was my first time in trestment for my eating dirorders and other mental health concerns. Things go worse, I got transferred to inpatient to stabalize and then went to another program in another state. The treatment was good however about a month before I came home,  I was sexually was assaulted by a driver from a popular. Service that gives rises and didn't talk about it till a couple days later, the treatment center didn't do much for me in reguards to that , I didnt tell my boyfriend till two weeks after the fact. I summed up the courage to file a report the day before I flew back to where I am originally from. Right now I am waiting for the DA to contact me to see if I have a case. Its been 4 months and no word. I keep checking in. On living with my family again, our relationahip is healthier but I havent been able to tell them what happened to me. My boyfriend and I are struggling with things, though he is supportive. I still have flashbacks about what hapoened and overall I am going \"ok\".  I still hold a lot of shame and blame myself about what happened and I know that eventually I will hsve to deal with court and telling my family. I dont know why I feel the need to protect them from the truth. A couple things are better but I'm not sure if maybe that's just on the surface. Things are bittersweet, After going to treatment for my mental health concerns, standing up to my family and learning to be more authentic with my needs, I have learned A lot about myself and have grown in maturity. I refuse to be a victim in life now and I tske it one day at a time. I'm happy to say that most of the time,  I look forward to life more today and have replaced most of my suicidal thoughts with contemplation reaching out, and gratitude most of the time.  My family does not understand why I have mood swings . they dont know I cried myself to sleep last night. Things are complicated.I am trying to move on with my life. I am waiting for a job offer as a Clinical Allergy Technician tomorrow. I am looking forward to becoming a dietician AND a pastry chef who owns some bakeries one day. This was a lot and tirned into a little venting. Thanks for listening. I am trying to stay resilient.",

            "selftext": "There was this girl that I like a lot. I told my homeboy about her and that I was trying to get with her. As being a good friend he pushed me along with it and gave me motivation. We talked for a while and she ended up becoming part of our squad (bad idea).  We were close but we started becoming closer, after school we would hang out all night she would be at my house all day or I would be at her's.  We would smoke and drink through most nights and we created a huge bond with each other.   Most of the time I had her attention 24/7 I was happy that I found this chick and was hopefully going to make something of it. A few weeks or so go by and I noticed I start losing her attention more and more. She wouldn't respond for hours and when she did it would be black screens and it wouldn't say very much at the same time I would try to talk to my homie and it would be the same thing. This made me question things a lot.  this went on for more than a month and when I talked to her about not responding and being distant she told me not to worry about it. I tried but I couldn't it was always on my mind. This one morning I went to go lift and when I had gotten home she was at my house and she was drunk and in her feels so she went to my place. At the time I was mad at her for reasons I can't remember I was ignoring her and she ended up going into the bathroom and started crying. I went in there and she was balling her eyes out and told me that her and my homeboy were messing around and that he used her for sex and just played with her feelings. This felt horrible it had felt like someone stabbed me in the heart at this point I was already depressed and had very little motivation in life. I didn't know how to react or even continue I held everything in me until this point. I spilled my guts to her which seemed to not matter. After that, I gave her my opinion and ways to attack it. She never listened and continued to get played. It hurt a lot to see her get played especially by my homeboy it was on my mind 24/7  a couple more weeks go by and still little attention from her. She knew I was depressed and had a hard time keeping up with myself. I remember the long nights sitting in my room just thinking crying and wondering why this all happened. even after all of this I still continued to have feelings for her knowing in the back of my mind that nothing would become of it but at the same time, it pushed me harder to try for some reason. eventually, I had given up and tried to forget about her so I went out and hooked up with someone. In the back of my mind, it didn't feel right but I continued with it. a month goes by and her and my homeboy had taken a \"break\" she was moving in a couple of months and things died down with them. One weekend she had come over and we just took some acid we were vibing in my room things went normal we just tripped and relaxed together. towards the end of the acid trip, we tried to get some sleep she kept putting her leg on me and tried to cuddle with me. I ignored her for the reason I didn't want to fall for her again she just ended up asking me if I wanted to anything. So we did we fucked and during it in the back of my mind I was happy this I what I wanted her but at the same time, I felt wrong and odd. But fuck it, its what I wanted.  She didn't want me to say anything about it. I still haven't she moved now and she's like my sister at this point but apart of me is still broken and hurt inside from all of this. I wish I could have gone back and changed things and prevented things. But it is what it is I've learned a lot from this im still friends with him we've been friends since elementary and were seniors now I still haven't told him about any of this and a part of me wants to but I just can't. I guess the point of all of this is just to vent so much shit that's been on my chest for ages. The thing is her and my homeboy are still messing around and it still hurts but apart of me has given up doesn't care anymore. The motto I learned at the end of the day is you can't trust these females but at the same time i still love that female",

The little money I can manage to save I always end up spending because something always comes up (health issues, apartment maintenance, car maintenance, etc).   \nI don't have a great diet and my family from both sides are diabetic, have heart problems or both.  \nI was unemployed for 4 months before my current job and managed to sustain myself because when my dad died, I inherited some money.  \nI had a promising job with a good above average salary for but that was once on a lifetime kind of job and my boss died. Where I currenty work, they pay me half of what I did and I am working 70-80 hours a week.  \nRight now I'm only working to survive, without anychance of any salarial raise and no other opportunity has appeared. I've been patient for 8 months and I'm fed up.  \nWhen I get home I immedietly cook dinner, I take a bath, wash my working clothes and just sleep 4 to 5 hours just to wake up early to get to work.  \n\n\n(I don't live in the States, I live in Dominican Republic; it's the big island in the Caribbean.)  \n\n\nMonthly expenses\n\n\\- My rent: 200 dollars  \n\\- Food expenses: 80 dollars  \n\\- Gas expenses: 80 dollars (In my country a gallon of regular gas is 5 dollars)  \n\\- Internet, electricity and water: 60 dollars\n\nTOTAL: 420 dollars  \n\n\nMy salary  \n\\- Monthly salary: 450 dollars  \n\n\nDebt:  \n\\- Credit card: 100 dollars  \n\\- Rent: 50 (I owe this because I had to use some of the rent money to go to emergency)  \n\n\nIn my country it's hard to climb because usually you have an opportunity only if you know important people or you have close family member who is a politician\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do.

However, something happened. I was able to see that I hit rock bottom and a combination of a few small things allowed me to make a few friends. I eventually got a girlfriend, the girl next door to my room. I had a solid friend group and a really good girlfriend. I felt amazing and it was the first time I was enjoying life and was happy in as long as I can remember.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast month I learned that my girlfriend was cheating on me with the other guy in that friend group. The other friends took their side and completely cut me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI no longer have any friends and the same things are happening again. I cannot think or focus on schoolwork and am abusing weed again. I am failing all of my classes and want to kill myself again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cure for my depression really was having good friends and a girlfriend. I only had three or four bad days in a six-month period where before I spent years in constant pain and wanting to kill myself. I almost killed myself last summer and before I met these people. I have never felt more alive, happier, or more confident in myself and my future than when I had these friends and my ex girlfriend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really don't know what to do now. I keep hearing \"focus on yourself\" and \"take a break from school and figure yourself out\". But that is the problem. I was doing so well academically because I was doing so well socially. I cannot do well socially without school. There are no people to meet in my hometown. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdvice?",

            "selftext": "Skipping over a lot of boring details, I don't really have any hobbies. I sometimes play video games and read a book, but I don't really consider those to be hobbies as much as diversions and lately they feel more like something I do out of obligation than actual enjoyment. These days, the highlight of my week is a depression support group on Sundays, and even that is starting to lose its appeal lately. So wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to go about finding a new hobby. Now, you couldn't have thought it would be *that* easy, so here are some of the issues.\n\n1. I'm unemployed, so have plenty of time, but no money\n2. I am very bad at small talk when I do not know someone\n3. I have a very fair complexion, so I can't really be outside in the sun for long periods of time\n4. I'm fat and out of shape, so most athletic related activities are out\n5. Lately my depression seems to be coming in waves... sometimes I feel almost normal, then I start feeling like shit again, then I feel better, etc\n6. I have no idea what my passions are/might be... I tried one of those \"find your passion\" books that says to just write whatever you're thinking for a few minutes on certain questions, but the answers were just making me even more depressed\n7. If it involves anything more complex than a badly done stick figure, I can't draw to save my life, so artistic things are out\n8. I have basically a single friend, who works a lot, and his wife consumes a lot of whatever free time he does have, and the nearest family I have is about 1,500 miles away, not that it matters since I have as little as possible to do with my siblings (they were abusive and stole shit from me pretty much all the time) and they're 5 &amp; 7 years older than me, so we don't have a lot in common anyway\n\nI've tried looking at a couple sites that list volunteer jobs, but nothing stood out to me even a little bit, same with Meetup. There's no \"That's it!\" moment or even just an \"I suppose.\" I just need something to help fill my days beyond mindlessly watching TV, dicking around aimlessly on Facebook, playing video games, or having to reread several pages in a book because I realized I spaced out and don't remember anything I just read.",

At first I thought that I had an ear infection because of some piercings I got but looking for the symptoms I have, I didn't found anything about it until it hit me that a week ago I kinda stopped cold turkey  taking the pills. I'm dizzy all day, have chills and shocks like every five minutes, my chest feel heavy, I feel like I'm having a fever, I feel this constant buzzing on my ears and my head hurts like hell. I also feel so exhausted and fatigued, my appetite for sweets increased and I feel like crying for everything. I tried controlling the headache with some Advil but it doesn't work. I just want to know how can I reduce these symptoms for this week until I get my prescription again.",

I almost died once in a car accident, being suddenly _winked_ out of existence, only to wake up with 20 minutes of my life missing, a broken body, and a car engulfed in flames, having been saved by my now-wife, her hurling my unconscious body out the passenger side with seconds to spare before \n\nThat being said, I don't really feel like I want to be here alive, existing (even when I'm not depressed).  I feel wholeheartedly that the absence of experience would be better than living, even with its high points (and I there have been *plenty* of those).   For all the good that's possible, existence in general just seems like a huge bother, and even getting between those high points feels like an un-necessary slog--I truly wish I could hand my life over to someone who'd appreciate it more.\n\nI'm not suicidal right this moment, but I feel that given the chance to undo everything in a way that would leave everyone in my life blissfully unaware that I ever existed, I'd tug that string and disentangle myself from the tapestry woven without my \n\n  One would think that a new lease on life woul be invigorating, but all it's done is put into my mind that suicide done right (totally down for a .45 caliber aspirin), would have the transition to unconsciousness/bliss be immediate, painless, and not something to fear.\n\nI'm not really feeling that I'm living my life for me, there is nothing that I can do that I would find really fulfilling, and I feel as if I'm just going through the motions.  I've felt this way for the past decade and a half, but I can't bring myself to hurt my mom (who is a fucking ANGEL) or my wife (who is amazing).\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm writing this, but the darkness is comforting, like an old familiar friend.",

Over the years I\u2019ve gone from being such an outgoing, social butterfly to valuing time alone more so than any other.  Aside from the time I spend with my children, I feel as though my peers (25-35 year olds) just don\u2019t seem to peak my interest.  I don\u2019t really understand what changed, but I can attribute a lot of my attitude changes to stress.  I\u2019ve spoken with a therapist on a biweekly basis for months now, and have been on Lexapro (if that\u2019s how you spell it) for depression.  Aside from a much needed relief from constant irritability, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m fond of being such a loner.  I literally tell my gf and family I\u2019m going to hang out with friends and wind up driving around alone for hours, or find a bar or restaurant to eat at my myself.  \n\nAnyone else feel like they\u2019ve noticed similar changes in themselves?  All of this was going on before the Lexapro so I can\u2019t really attribute it solely to medication.  Is this type of personality change normal?  These questions have accounted for roughly 95% of my thoughts for weeks now.  I just don\u2019t feel like myself, and quite frankly when I try to revert to \u201cold ways\u201d of having a good time, I\u2019m just completely bored and regret even trying and just go home and eat a bunch of food and struggle to sleep until finally I pass out.",

            "selftext": "I had a normal job for a little bit after college, but ended up hating it and quit to travel and work on a business. The business went extremely well and I made $1 million at the age of 25. Sounds good, but...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1: I cannot relate to a single person. Nobody knows the inner workings of what I do for a living, and I cannot talk about it intelligently to a single person I have ever met in person or online.\n\n2: Most intelligent people assume it is impossible to make money how I make it. They chalk it up to complete 100% luck and assume my business will fail and I will lose everything. I can't tell them how successful I have been so they assume I am just starting out. Someone today actually told me that everyone he ever knew who tried to make money how I make money has committed suicide by jumping out of a window. And he was a very respected and wealthy individual (Must be worth at a minimum $10 million and runs his own business).\n\n3: I spend so much of my time thinking about my business with the occasional extremely well planned actionable duty that I am rather burnt out. But because so many people do not believe in me I have a constant desire to keep going to prove myself. But because so much of it is just thinking and online research, I come across as extremely lazy to the average person.\n\n4: Income is extremely volatile. One month I can make $50k, the next $0. Some days are emotional roller-coasters, and, as in number 1, I have zero people in my life I can commiserate with, seek advice from, bounce ideas off of. \n\n5: Random stuff such as buying a new Tacoma truck have made people think I am just throwing all my money away and irresponsibly racking up debt. Or I will go on a vacation somewhere and someone asks me why I'm not working on some corporation and get responses like \"Well we all make mistakes, kid. Maybe get a job at Starbucks\" or \"But you are just a dirtbag backpacker, you don't know anything\", etc. etc. High school/college friends who have a normal job seem to look down at me as a failure. It basically feels like the stigma of being unemployed.\n\n6: Dating people is very difficult because I appear unemployed to them. I tell them what I do and it must seem crazy. You cannot guess my income at all from what I do, and I can't bring up how successful I am. I just have to cross my fingers they hope I am not broke, but it seems like they all decide they cannot be with someone with such an uncertain career and want someone with more stability. I did hang out with a foreign woman from a dating site for a week, and it was the best week of my life - but my family seems very upset I met her and changes the topic if I bring her up at all.\n\n7: Every decision I have ever made in my business has been \"against the grain\" per say. Basically everyone I try to bounce ideas off of has told me \"that will never work\". Then it does. And the response is \"Well that was lucky\". Time after time after time and I can't stand it anymore. How many times do you have to succeed before it is clearly not luck?\n\n8: Basically all of this has made life in general seem so meaningless. My words, apparently, mean nothing. My assurances that I am doing well, mean nothing. Nobody to share successes and failures with, constantly being questioned over the bare minimal assumptions of my business I have ironed out years ago, etc. etc. Nothing makes sense anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading. Maybe I just wanted to vent a little. I know I am very privileged, but I feel isolated beyond belief.",

I feel that the absence of experience would be better than living, even with its high points (and I there have been *plenty* of those).   Existence in general just seems like a bother, and even getting between those high points feels like an un-necessary slog--I wish I could hand my life over to someone who'd appreciate it more.\n\nThere have been some pretty low lows, and were it not for the fact I'd hurt someone by killing myself, I'd have certainly done it.  I've almost died once being winked out of existence momentarily (20 minutes anterograde/retrograde amnesia from a consucssion in a car accident), and done right (totally down for a .45 caliber aspirin), the transition to unconsciousness/bliss is immediate, and painless, and not something I'm really afraid of.\n\nI'm not really feeling that I'm living my life for me, there is nothing that I can do that I would find really fulfilling, and I feel as if I'm just going through the motions.  I've felt this way for the past decade and a half, but I can't bring myself to hurt my mom (who is a fucking ANGEL) or my wife (who is amazing).\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm writing this, but the darkness is comforting, like an old familiar friend.",

I opened up to him about how I feel and how much I care for him. \"Friends\" doesn't quite cut it because we're more than friends. To me, he's family and I would go to hell and back for him. But here's where my problem lies:\n\nI don't have a fuckin clue what I'm doing when it comes to depression and I'm terrified that I'll fuck it up for him. My ex had depression and when she relied on me to fix it, I did a lot of research and luckily **none** of it helped at all. I ended up making things worse with my lack of knowledge and general scatter brain-ness. I want to help my friend but I'm worried that I'll fuck it up again and I'd never forgive myself if something happened to him when I could've been there for him. I recently learned that there's different types of depression and each type has its own set of rules and do's and don'ts.\n\nAlso, I don't have depression and I never have so I don't have any first experiences or knowledge. I don't know what it's like so I'm scared as hell to try to help him with something so alien to me.\n\nSo my question boils down to this: How do I help my friend with depression and specifically his type of depression? How do I even know which type it is? What kinds of things should I say or avoid saying?",

My performance in school gradually decreased, and now I've failed out of college twice. I feel like I'll never amount to anything, and even if I do it'll just be trying my hardest to get some job and work all day for idk what, basically the whole normie lifestyle thing.\n\nBut I cannot for the life of me genuinely connect with others. I would be fine doing the above if I could, but I can't.\n\nI just can't apply my talents, if I even have any. I'm frustrated, and I just don't see the fucking point anymore. I hate school. I want to leave ASAP. It's just a bullshit festival for resume stackers, not a place where people actually want to learn shit. I don't even want my degree, as I can't even pass sophomore classes while my peers are fucking graduating.\n\nI can't enlist in the military because I don't want to be able to not see my family in Russia again (or God forbid one day be ordered to shoot at Russians).\n\nHow do I do cool shit with my life?",

            "selftext": "Idk what to do   I have no one to talk to really or any one I deal comfortable talking with, and I've posted on reddit about 100 times now but I've decided to try so again... basically I feel really fucked up, and idk who to see or what to do about it and I have literally no guidance whatsoever and it's what I really need right now... I'm just delersonalized, depressed, anxious, the whole 9 yards. Wake up in the morning not wanting to get up at all, either dont eat or eat a fuck tun of food, then just not care about the rest of the day. I dont want to do anything not even participate in any old hobbies. And I end up fucking filling with hatred as soon as some one asks me to do something or for help etc and then I feel bad later about it. Then after that excuse for a day I spend an hour trying to fall asleep thinking about how I could kill my self or about people I could have hurt or people who hurt me etc etc. Generally I feel nothing other than  those bad emotions     anything but happy and loving and all those enjoyable emotions    the whole day I'm either pissed off, sad, miserable or whatever else. Only time I ever feel satisfactory is when I watch a couple episodes of old shows I've lost interest in. I'm only 18 and I'm an alcoholic but even that doesn't do anything for me anymore and im worried im gonna get into coke or oxy's like the rest of my family.... I have no friends, i moved to the other side of Canada to get away from everyone but I already got in a knife fight and almost killed somebody and been forced to be around drugs and now idk what to think. My mom does everything she can for me and I dont treat her the best   my dad does what he can and I call him a prick all the time but hes provided me with more then a good life. And I dont even talk to my sister anymore...     I had a rough time in school    only had a couple friends and most people fucked with me calling me a school shooter   looking back now they're lucky I didn't fucking hirt them cuz now I wouldn't hesitate to hurt someone if I'm in the right mind which is awful ik but I have nothing but hatred towards this world, life and society....    I've lost all interest in all my \"interests\" if that makes sense. If I'm being honest   I have alot of musical talent, I can play any instrument handed to me within a matter of seconds, main focuses were bagpipes, guitar, and rapping which were all wasted talents   just list interest in them which sucks.... \"too much effort I guess\"     I also use to love to play hockey, video games, hike and fish but even that has turned to shit, I have no interests or babies anymore... between sports, music and video games alone that's tens of thousands down the drain and my family isn't even that wealthy. Idk I could write a fucking book about how I feel but I'm gonna wrap this post up here... basically in reality, I'm an alcoholic depressed lonely misserable 18 year old who deals as if life is fake, useless and who is also emotionally numb excluding destressful emotions. And I want to get some sort of help. Just want to feel normal again, be able to hang out with my old friends, have interests and no what it's like to feel happy. Haven't felt happy for years. I use to be extremely humble after a few major concussions and heavy experiences from smoking pot but that's turned into shit... depersonalized, panicky angry shit. Idk I probably sound like a fucking idiot but idc. Just want to know what to do    cant talk to my parents about it    have no friends, last time i went to a doctor they just turned into an ass hole so ye, idk what I'm saying now but any suggestions would be cool   thank u...\n\n\n(Just so u all know I haven't hurt anyone or intend on hurting anyone just explaining what happened and what could have happened   the knife fight was in self defense and was delt with properly by the police and no one got hurt but we definatly could have hurt or possibly killed each other which I have learned from)",

I [19M] have never been in a relationship and feel like I\u2019ve been running on self motivation for far to long. I work and go to school while living with my parents, I try to focus on improving myself through doing good at school and working out but for most of this I have to find motivation from myself to get it done and I\u2019m getting tired from it. The fact that I\u2019ve never been in a relationship where I can have someone to lean on at least sometimes weigh on me heavily increasingly my depression ten fold. I\u2019m reaching my wits end with just trying to keep myself occupied and thinking about just quitting everything and giving up. I currently hate myself all the time and often find myself calling myself ugly and worthless and that no girl will ever wanna be with me so why bother putting myself out there because I\u2019ll only get rejected no matter what.\n\nAny advice or support would be appreciated",

It was terrifying and even though I was surrounded by teammates and later medical staff, I was completely alone. Everytime the dying part was horrible, the being dead part was wonderful. So now I have a kind of elevated \"homesickness\" for being dead but I'm not quite ready to go through the dying part.

I live with my distant mother and my abusive brother, as well as my father, who is one of the only good people in my life. I have some friends, but I've been having trouble connecting with them over time. I've been having trouble connecting to anybody to be honest. I just feel like an alien or a monkey pretending to be human, I don't feel welcome or natural anywhere. I used to like being around people, but everyone I meet just kind of sucks. I used to be upset I never had a girlfriend, and then I dated 2 abusive girls for a couple months each and I'm convinced I don't deserve any better. I don't think I deserve anything to be honest, I think rats probably deserve more than me.\n\nI'm hoping to kill myself soon. I hate so many things about myself and it seems easier to off myself than to try and fix them. I feel like everybody who says they care about me will realize how much better life is without me in it. They'll probably be upset for a while, but eventually they'll be happier. I'm actively detracting from the human race by continuing to breath, I'll be doing something right by killing myself. I'm loud, obnoxious, dumb, unattractive, apathetic. People say I'm funny, but I'm pretty sure they're just fucking with me.\n\nSo, I guess I'm asking if you guys have any recommendations for how best to kill myself? and how to work up the courage to kill myself?

The trauma tortures me every day of my life, it consumes me. I can't function as a normal person, i don't have any social life, i lost my personality, ambitions, dreams &amp; goals. Now i just feel like a walking corpse, empty. \nIt's really hard to sleep at night, almost everyday now i have to take medicine so i can sleep throught the night. This indulced sleep does not help at all, i still feel exhausted all day. \nEverything got worse gradually recently, i'm having extreme mental breakdowns like 2/3 times a day. It's so painful, i'm full of anxiety and despair.\nThe suicidal thoughts are coming back again, i'm fighting so hard against them. I'm scared and this is so painful.\nI guess the only thing we can have when dealing with mental illnesses is hope. Hope that someday we'll be healthy again, someday our efforts will have results, some day we won't need to take medicines to stop our brains from killing itself.\nI can't even remember how it was to live without depression, seems like a bright colorful dream so far away. \nHow do you guys cope with depression and days like that? I can't get out of the bed or do anything, i can't even sleep because i have a anxiety attack everytime i try to sleep without meds.\nI'm sorry if this post seems all out of place, i'm dissociating a lot right now and i don't know how to end this, just remember:\n\"You didn't come this far to only come this far\".\nStay strong, it will get better soon. \ud83d\udc96",

Never been diagnosed with depression but am thinking I may have it. \n\nOddly I have managed to be decently successful(perhaps not by LA standards however). I make well into six figures and dont have to worry about typical bills and such that I know many others do. But honestly I'm feeling burnt out. \n\nSocial factors: I have a good group of friends but most of them are back in my home town a few hours away. I've made a few here but it's hard to be motivated to hang out with them. \n\nMedical factors: I do have anxiety and am prescribed xanax for it. I take the medication as needed, in a low dose. Used to have panic attacks but I've managed to not have one for a long time, now just generalized anxiety. From what I read anxiety and depression are at least a little related. I'm not looking to get on ti antidepressants, ideally I'd like to get off xanax in the near future.   \n\nEveryone advice is to get a hobby, however I have a really fucked up knee that keeps me from the sports I once loved(bball, Bjj). Not into arts, crafts or anything like that. \n\n\nI know this is a pretty damn unorganized post, but perhaps was just hoping to find someone to relate to. I know I shouldn't complain as much of the world lives in a constant financial struggle, but i wake up every day questioning my desire to be here anymore.",

            "selftext": "Holy fuck do I hate myself for this. Ok so the track people left for a track meet, so they let us go outside for an hour. We were fast walking in the hallway, but a dumbass teacher took it as running and made us go back and \u201ctry it again.\u201d So two people took the swings that me and a friend and I were in. When I got back, I asked if I could have the swing back, but they said no. A lot of shit has been happening recently, so I\u2019ve been getting easily agitated. So I started full on yelling and cussing at them to get out. The teacher got involved, and she knew that I wasn\u2019t mad over the swing, so she tried comforting me which actually helped; it was like she understood what I was going through. I started crying and I felt like such a fucking pussy for crying just because I got a TINY bit upset because something minor happened at the wrong time. I feel so embarrassed now that I look back at it. Someone just took a swing I was swinging in, and I was full on screaming at them which resulted in me crying and a teacher holding me and trying to comfort me. What the fuck kind of weakling am I? No wonder people don\u2019t want to be my friend. I hate me. Why am I even here if I can\u2019t handle something minor like that?",

I\u2019m getting anxious about the thought of needing to listen to her again and I know my performance is gonna slip again.\n\nShe slags you off behind your back, constantly calls you rubbish (she uses harsher words than that), she calls you negative, she never praises you, she said to me a few days ago well done then implied I\u2019m only doing so well as I don\u2019t work that much, why couldn\u2019t she just praise me.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has ever had similar work scenarios\n\nI tried to quit before but my family wouldn\u2019t let me, and the pay is really good and the hours they do really work around my other commitments\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for here just thought I\u2019d share my story I guess.",

            "selftext": "Ever since I saw a video about depression/suicidal thoughts I have been very anxious that I may have depression or I am suicidal. I had just gotten over a fears of heart disease, kidney disease, or potentially having a stroke. But now since Saturday I have been very anxious that I may start being very sad or start harming myself. But, these things have been freaking me out and distracting me from doing things. I didn\u2019t have these thoughts until I saw this video. But over the past few days I have been fearing that I am becoming sad or when I am laughing I think that it isn\u2019t real. And I am having intrusive thoughts about self harm/suicide but that makes me really scared because I\u2019m worried that my mind will force me to act on these thoughts. I still am sleeping kinda normally, have the same hygiene and going to school and talking to my friends but these thoughts are always on my mind and distracting me. Every time I try to chill out and listen to music I get distracted by these stupid thoughts. I have also now been very sensitive to things talking about depression/suicide and also occasionally irritable. I get really anxious that I may do something even though I probably won\u2019t. Also since seeing some starter pack while looking up depression and not knowing I saw one about not enjoying music which really freaked me out. Maybe I just can\u2019t focus on music cause I\u2019m anxious But I have no idea cause my mind is really screwing around with me. I\u2019m sorry for the long post but this has been really scaring/ pissing me off recently and I don\u2019t want to go crazy. I know you people are not medical professionals but am I really becoming depressed or is this another health fear. Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "Hey all. Another day of absolute random depression has hit me (it happens quite often but some aren\u2019t this bad as I choose to ignore it). I don\u2019t have many friends I can talk to about this so I thought I\u2019d give Reddit a go. \n\nFirst about being treated unfairly. First of all, my family don\u2019t believe in things like depression so here goes. Being in an Asian family, (or maybe there\u2019s others out there that are the same) especially the middle child absolutely sucks. I\u2019m the only female as I have 1 older and 1 younger brother and our age gap is about 3-4 years apart. My mother treats them nicer than me and I\u2019ve noticed them over the years. One example includes, talking to them in a nicer tone (happier) and when I talk to her, she RARELY sounds happy unless I give her good news about school/job. (About school: I once showed her my high grades that I achieved in a difficult course (in college), doesn\u2019t congratulate me or tell me encouraging words like\u201ckeep up the good work!\u201d vs. my little brother (in gr 9) getting a slightly above average grade and she sounded so damn happy. About job: she ALWAYS bugs me about finding a job and when I finally found one (temp with above minimum wage pay, was starting at 7am), she still talks me down saying things like \u201coH don\u2019t think you\u2019re able to go to work since you don\u2019t ever wake up at 7am.\u201d Newsflash, I never wake up as early as 7am unless I NEED to.) Other than that, she just gives me a harsh tone as if she\u2019s never happy to see me. \nAnother example (much smaller but I\u2019ll put it here anyway) would be that whenever we eat and there\u2019s dishes. Idk if other Asian families are like this but in my case, my mom would tell my brothers to eat this or that more. When we\u2019re out and eating, she never asks me if I\u2019ve eaten this dish yet but pesters my brothers (especially older) if they had eaten it yet. Completely ignores that fact that I\u2019m there as well. Feeling left out. (Others in a family whose parent doesn\u2019t do this, you won\u2019t quite understand) \nAnother example: once in a train, she asked my opinion on a matter and asked my little brother too beforehand. I gave it to her but after that, I literally snapped. (No I didn\u2019t yell in public lmao) I asked her why she needed my opinion when my little brother already gave her his. Till this day, my opinions were NEVER taken into consideration if one or not both of my brothers already gave theirs. I said \u201cWhy do you even ask for my opinion if you never cared about it? You\u2019re just going to listen to my brothers instead so why ask for mine?\u201d She never responded and kept quiet. \n\nNow for discouragement. This mainly focuses on school but first I\u2019d like to address a situation that happened not too long ago. In one of her usual subtle moments of talking down on me, I got angry and told her with a shaking voice, \u201ccould you stop doing that? Why is it so fun for you to talk down on me?\u201d She had the audacity to continue, talked over me and smirked. Continuing with school, being the second child, I get so much pressure from my mom. Indirectly saying things like \u201chey your older brother is in university, why aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYou better apply to other universities.\u201d (But because of certain admission reasons, I cannot and no matter how many times I told her that she wouldn\u2019t listen. Plus she doesn\u2019t read it herself soo) My personal goal is to graduate with a nursing degree at the same university my older brother attends. One day on vacation, my family went back to Singapore to visit my relatives and we visited my grandparents. My grandma and mom sat down, while I sat in front of them. They were talking about school and I came up. My mom saying that I want to pursue nursing and my grandma said \u201cnursing? You sure you can handle it? You sure you want to wipe people\u2019s asses and clean them, etc.?\u201d My mom further talked me down with her. At first I calmly told them that the field of nursing is big, that if I do become a nurse, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to be the typical type of nurse that cleans people. (That\u2019s their fixated view on what a nurse typical do.) surprise, they didn\u2019t listen to what I had to say and continued to talk down. I wanted to scream. I held back on my tears so hard that day because if I cried, they would laugh at me. \n\nHere I thought that those in your family were suppose to encourage you to pursue your dreams, not tell you that your dreams are impossible. Turns out it\u2019s all a lie for me. \n\nI don\u2019t have any close friends. The people I call \u201cfriends\u201d rarely talks to me, they\u2019d only talk to me if they need to rant about something. I\u2019m a good listener, so I just listen to them and give advice/comfort them. However when I try to talk to them about my problems, they just give short answers like \u201coh\u201d or \u201clol\u201d. The thing with friends is, something horrible happened in high school (I was with a group of friends) and it gave me PTSD. Ever since that, I struggle to make friends. That event that gave me PTSD would always show up. What\u2019s worse is that a guy friend i met in high school and knew him for 5 years disappeared all of a sudden. We dated for only 2 months and I told him quite a few times about how thankful I am for him to be in my life, he listened to my rants back when I was in a really abusive relationship. He was the only one out of my friends to call me out and hang out because texting isn\u2019t his way of dealing with hardships. I was very happy, called him an angel, a saviour, etc. Anyway, he blocked me without telling any reasons so in terms of relationship, that final act crushed my hearts into pieces, more than it ever needed to be. Given the additional struggles I have to put up with at home. \n\nSo whenever I\u2019m depressed or felt like shit hit the fan, I literally have no one in my connections I can turn to. Sorry to that one friend that calls me their \u201cbest friend\u201d, I hate when people use that term when it clearly doesn\u2019t apply to what our friendship really is. No one around takes me seriously. The only one that did was that so called \u201cangel\u201d that left me after saying \u201cI didn\u2019t leave because I didn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d Yup, great fucking job for doing that. \n\nI wonder how is it like having a genuinely supportive family and friends hmm. \n\nP.S. sorry for the long rant. I hadn\u2019t ranted out my feelings for years and I feel a little bit better. \n\nI did resort to physical harm once but other than that, I\u2019ve been doing ok (trying to strengthen my mental health). Hope everyone else reading this is doing well. Those of you facing much more pain, remember that a small step forward is a great progress.  :)",

            "selftext": "In school, I would always be treated as that stupid kid in class. My brother was the opposite, he used to top the school. We used to be compared to others in school. One was a high-achiever, the other was the low-achiever (me). The teachers would use us as an example of \"Don't be like him. Be like his brother instead.\" However, this only has made me stronger in facing rejection and made me over-ambitious to prove them wrong. Immediately after school, I had enrolled into uni in Marketing (as I was pretty goal-less and not driven). But, a couple of years into the course, I finally found my sense of purpose in life through Antarctica's 2041 peace treaty. I had found out that my ambition was the help renew that peace treaty to make sure Antarctica would still be intact when it comes to that day. I had even joined the Army for 3 years to get outdoors experience. \n\nFast forward a few years later, I went to study law (should have picked up Science), but had become so broke in the process that I lived in my car for a few weeks, only dropping out after that. That city that I went to was a student town and there were minimal jobs there. Now, I am in the fall-back plan of working in Marketing and having to do nothing related to Antarctica or Science. And my depression has kicked back in and crippling me to the point of thinking what is the purpose of living, when I could just end it all in a few minutes. I don't know how to progress, and I can't fathom to work in marketing for the rest of my life. \n\nThe important lessons I learned if I could relive:\n\n\\- Not expecting too much in life\n\n\\- Having a role model (this will guide you toward what you want to do in the future)",

I was completely lost, just stumbling aimlessly from one blunder to the next. I was living with my parents again, relying on them for everything, and without a job, I didn't have any money either. But when January 1st hit, I felt this surge of energy that got me off my feet and gave my life some long lost momentum. I worked my ass off for the next few months, trying to turn things around. I thought I'd never be able to qualify, but I managed to get into a prestigious graduate school. I got a couple jobs and pushed myself to earn more money than ever before. I got myself on a strict diet and exercise plan and shed around 30 pounds of fat. \n\nI finally have a plan for the future, and I'm on track to becoming completely independent from my parents. I have more money in my bank account than I've ever had before. And while I'm still mostly a lonely recluse, I'm at least living an active lifestyle. I'm not just staying at home all the time. I go to work and actually interact with people. \n\nThis time last year, I never imagined I could have come this far. I feel like I should be proud and grateful with the life I have today, but I'm not. I look back, and it's like all the footprints in the path I walked have already faded, like I never actually took a single step. Good things keep happening to me, but I'm not any happier. No matter what happens to me, my mind warps it until it seems like nothing has changed. \n\nYesterday, I woke up, checked my bank account, and was surprised to find that my tax returns had come in and I was a couple grand richer. A year ago, I did not even have a couple grand, but getting that money yesterday, I felt some mild emotion resembling happiness for a second, and then I just went back to feeling sad and frustrated. \n\nToday, I checked my email to find that I had earned a substantial scholarship for grad school. Again, nothing. It took my mind half a second to take this positive thing that happened and turn it into nothing. It's like I took a couple steps forward but my brain tricks me into believing I'm not actually moving.\n\nThings are happening in my life again, and they're mostly good things. But I'm feeling sad and defeated. All that positive emotion that drove me to this point is gone. And it seems like all I can do is wait for it to come back, and who knows when that'll be.",

I have been heavily depressed for over a year now , and this has been the worst and longest depressive episode of my life. \n\nDespite my attendance at college being less than 5%, doing barely any work, not leaving my bed for days on end most of the time, and pushing everyone away to the point I have no supports, getting drunk constantly alone to cope, binge eating and relapsing a few times with self harm.. despite all of this mess that I am, I have managed to stay in college, I have managed to get an A in most assignments even though I had to get extensions for almost everything , I have kept up my job the whole time and have set up a  voluntary summer internship for myself with no prompting from anyone. \n\nThese may be small things but to me , even the smallest of tasks seems like a mountain.\n\nI feel proud, because even though this has been the worst year of my life, even though I spend most days in bed wondering how I should kill myself, even though I have no friends left because of my behavior when I drink from being depressed, even though I don\u2019t have any support or help, I managed to do okay in college, I still had what people would consider a successful year. It has taken me until today to realize I should be proud that I\u2019m even in college, let alone my grades, and that I have persevered through my depression. \n\nI still hate myself. I still hate the person that I am and the life that I lead and I hate every one of my dirty coping mechanisms. But today, for the first time in I\u2019d say at least 5 months, I have felt sympathy for myself, I have felt self compassion, and even a flicker of care for myself. I want to get back to the place I used to be where I truly loved myself. That person was so beautiful and I miss her. I was so happy. \n\nBut today may be a step towards getting better. Maybe if I stop believing I\u2019m a failure all the time and let myself be proud of small things more often I will improve and learn to love myself. \n\nI am proud.",

I just figured asking in person would be the best way to go.\nI'm just not sure what I'll say.\nThere's no emergency and I'm not sick physically. \nI just go to sleep every day right after school and by the time I wake up its school again... \n\nWhat can I say to her? I already struggled last quarter and now this. It's not unrecoverable but it really puts all the weight into acing every tests.\nI've read similar threads and they seem to recommend the disability Office at the school. Would something like that work in my case? I also don't have a official diagnosis which might be needed?",

During this time I would be sitting at home and basically be doing nothing near as exciting as them. I remember just breaking down at the thought of how different my life could have been had I stayed, although that wouldn't have been a great option either for personal reasons but I believe it would be better.\n\n\nMy ideology is that if you enjoy your childhood, you can go on to educate yourself and become what you want to be. I never had the childhood my friends did and they will never know why. \n\n\nHaving visited twice in a row in two years, I almost had a mental breakdown at the amazing times I had there with friends and family. I truly believe that I would have been better off there although it is a vastly different and less developed country than the one I am currently in. \n\nWalking through the streets of where I grew up and seeing where I grew up whilst being able to navigate my way through the fairly small town was an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life. \n\nIt was during this time that I had remembered times which I had spent with my grandfather before he made the decision to leave. With all of his imperfections, he was often a good father figure to me when I didn't have my own.\n\nJust that has taken me a couple of tears to type up.\n\nEver since he passed, I have felt an extremely strong attachment to this town. This is where I belong. I cannot move forward without doing something. And I don't know what that something is. I searching for what my grandfather wanted so that I may carry on in this horrible horrible world in which good people die.\n\n\nThank you for reading.",

Like I wish I was born without empathy so I wouldn't fee l so bad all the time. I study politics and it's just so sad that we cannot have an equal society. I don't think would ever be 100% possible, but it could be so much better. But, people just do not have enough access to education to understand the world/their world better. And of course, I am making some assumptions. I'm staunchly a liberal progressive. I have some ideas that overlap and conflict with each other, but overall studying contemporary political theory is just depressing. It really depends what you study, but just in general shit is depressing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, almost everything in society is just a social construct, it's made up. Like money. It's not real, but it's real because we say it's real. Race. It doesn't exist. There is no scientific backing. But it doesn't matter cause we still believe it is real anyways. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get to take for granted that some modern day things we have like freedom of speech or democracy were once progressive ideals at one point at history. Like it is crazy that so many philosophers wrote about ideas that had and many never even got to see them. Like it only took a few hundred years for some of those ideals to be accepted today. Even then, most countries don't even have them. So what hope do I have that society can actually become a happy place?",

I've never seen the Harry potter movies, so i bought them all on special. I'm watching them with my sister, day by day. Today we watched the fourth one.\n\nBut after every movie, I get into a major slump and just feel so depressed it's unbearable. I have no idea what's causing it.\n\nMaking things worse, I feel kind of isolated. I don't have many friends left to talk to, most of them have had falling outs or moved away, so I'm left with no social life. I live with family, so I'm not totally alone.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. I've doubled my SSRIs, and I really want to finish the series, but it's got me down like no other.\n\nAny advice?",

I doesn\u2019t matter how many people I help in this world or how many things I do it all is just a useless waste of energy nothing is worth anything to me anymore. I have given up in school my family my friends and everything else I cared about when I was naive. I used to believe that I could make a difference or an impact in the world but no matter how hard I try nothing I can do will ever be worth anything I hate knowing this fact I miss being the naive kid I was because people are right when they say ignorance is bliss because I can\u2019t just forget knowing this I can\u2019t just change my mind or my feelings. There is no god no higher power because if their was it wouldn\u2019t leave this world in the state it is wars being fought everywhere lives being taken I honestly can\u2019t believe in a god that would let its own creation be destroyed and not even intervene. I just faze through the motions of life not really even paying attention most the day I sit at a desk straight faces not even listening thinking of how useless i am. Then I come home and go to my basement so that I don\u2019t have to listen to my parents asking me about how my day was and why I don\u2019t have a girlfriend because lying to them just gets so exhausting and hard. So I just sit around until an ungodly hour of the night then I slump to my bed and sleep until morning and repeat the whole process again and again and again and that is my plan until my life ends by either my hand or by some other way I honestly don\u2019t care which. sure my life can change I can get a job i can go to college but my fazing through the motions will never stop because weirdly it\u2019s the only way I can cope. I am invisible to almost everyone in my life or at least the real me is. no one knows what I\u2019m going through no one knows what I\u2019ve endured and quite frankly I\u2019m just sick of being useless. So if there is anyone out there who can help me feel purpose in living or who can tell me why I\u2019m not useless then please tell me I\u2019m begging you because it\u2019s driving me insane... and I really don\u2019t know how long I have left in this world.",

I have big dreams but don\u2019t have the will to put in the work to achieve them. I look at all my friends and wonder how they are able to set goals and meet them whereas I struggle. I go through feelings of guilt and anger for not doing my work but can\u2019t seem to do it despite being angry with myself. My room is kinda messy but not too serious. I go through life not really having much emotion, but I am quick to anger when I feel someone else is doing something wrong. I masturbate 1-2x per day, and am obsessed with my fitness, and sometimes go through bouts of paranoia. on the other hand, i take care of myself, go to class (in university) and have friends and activities to do. However i feel isolated sometimes and can be awkward during conversation because I don\u2019t really know what to say. I don\u2019t really FEEL happy, I feel nothing mostly, but idk if that\u2019s normal or if you are supposed to feel nothing until a happy event occurs causing you to feel happy.\n\nAfter reading online about walking depression, some of the symptoms match but others don\u2019t. My question is: is it possible I have mild depressive tendencies, or am I just a normal teenager who is lazy?",

I feel like I am ungrateful because I have an amazing girlfriend, mostly good grades and a generally great family. I feel like I am being held by a rope around my wrist over the edge of a cliff: because I am painfully attached to my current reality. \n\nAnd again, my life is not bad - and I am well aware that it isn't - yet I feel like *negative* about it and desperately want to escape it. I shouldn't feel this way and I do. Everyday is a painful struggle... I sometimes wish I could give my life to someone who I feel would appreciate it more than me.\n\nI find it hard to talk about. I don't find social situations at all easy. In fact, my therapist and I only spoke about my social anxiety (which only plays up occasionally when I am online).\n\nI don't know what I expect from this...

I felt out of place. I couldnt crack jokes on the fly so I thought \"damn everybody here has the personality of a stand up comedian while I'm just a reserved hard working guy\". I dont stand a chance. I'm called in for my interview. It goes... eh. Not bad. Not the best. Just solid. \n\nWhat makes me cringe and feel bad to this very hour was me leaving the store. Upon finishing the interview, I walked past the break room and one employee kindly wished me luck \"Good luck\". It was within earshot although I had already passed by the breakroom and I didnt want to make it awkward by quickly going back 8 ft and saying \"thanks!\" Damn I feel bad. It was strange how nice everybody was though as I was leaving. \"How's it going?\" One would ask as I walk past on my way to the exit. After exiting, 3 people had already wished me luck for the position. What the heck man. I feel very insecure about my performance and personality but hey even if I dont get the position... \nI'm going to call the employer and thank them for their genuine kindness and service.",

But what should I do, wait for some moment in life when I'm better, if ever, so I can have a bf/gf?

            "selftext": "First reddit post, first post of this sorts. I don\u2019t post because I know it doesn\u2019t change anything but I wanted to do this because I want to experience this feeling as I\u2019ve seen people post things like this. Tomorrow feels different. Every time I\u2019ve been suicidal these past 3 years, I\u2019ve been suicidal based on emotion, based on severe mental pain. And that\u2019s still true of today and for tomorrow but it\u2019s different. I\u2019ve given everything I can and I\u2019ve waited my time. I feel a sense of peace which I can\u2019t quite explain right now. I\u2019ve experienced things and I feel as ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\n\nI\u2019ve had one suicide attempt based on heightened emotion and severe agitation from medication a couple years back. It didn\u2019t work and when I took the overdose I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to die. First period of time I\u2019d experienced such severe suicidal thoughts as well and they were so shocking and new I couldn\u2019t cope. The whole experience was horrendous, as expected and it changed how my family perceived me. I was to be made feel guilty by my parents. \n\nThe reason for my suicide and a lot of others is probably similar. I\u2019m in severe mental pain, just like others and have been for four years. Severe is just a word and know one can truly feel what that means because we\u2019re all different. Im only 20. I\u2019m young and already had enough of life. Things might change, I\u2019m aware that situations can change and time can do spectacular things. But they haven\u2019t through all my hoping and if they did they never lasted. I don\u2019t gain anything from life anymore unfortunately. I have MDD, BDP, ADHD, GAD, Psychosomatic pain disorder and depersonalisation/ derealisation disorder all which have been diagnosed. \n\nProbably heard this many times but of course I\u2019ve tried many treatments, several antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti anxiety drugs, adhd medication. Been terrible experiences. Done all types of therapy some not that well known. Nothing. Waiting to be referred to a clinic for ketamine injections but I\u2019m done waiting. Even if I felt better I knew it wouldn\u2019t last with my mind and brain. \n\nI\u2019ve had good times in this life: I\u2019ve made great friends over my years, I\u2019ve laughed and felt joy. I\u2019ve played sports and could of become professional but my mental health issues got too extreme. I lost my virginity. I gained confidence, I got better at socialising and flirting and building friendships. I earned respect from people I never could of done before. I  was falling in love with a girl which was an incredible and unexplainable feeling to anyone who hasn\u2019t felt that. But she cheated on me twice and I hit rock bottom again. I tried to pick myself up and I couldn\u2019t. How do you accept that the only person who you\u2019ve fallen for could break you heart and lie? I can\u2019t anyways.  The pain never goes. \n\nI\u2019ve had bad times more than good: I overdosed, I lost friends either from isolating myself or because they were bad people who lied or manipulated and used me, I\u2019ve become depersonalised and detached, I\u2019ve lost who I used to be and have never had a glimmer of it for years. I\u2019ve lost hope, lost feeling, lost life. My mind was first broken and then my heart. I ruminate, I panic. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve isolated my friends and somewhat overreacted so they somewhat are slightly less connected with me. I\u2019ve isolated my family so that they feel slightly less connected. My parents told me yesterday they will kick me out if I fail any exam coming up at university. My first year doesn\u2019t even count towards me degree. This is because I failed one out of 6 exams so far at uni. I found out I had been cheated on a second time one morning after my girlfriend went on a night out. I had an exam 2 hours later and took breaks to throw up. I completed half the paper and failed. Of course I would never tell my parents why and they genuinely wouldn\u2019t care. They called me stupid for failing. \n\nYesterday, they called me thick, stupid, a burden at times, short sighted, disrespectful. They told me to fuck off and said they would prefer if I rented my own place in the summer so that they could have a peaceful summer without me. I didn\u2019t throw a single insult to them or raise my voice because i feel like it\u2019s pointless. They weren\u2019t like this when I first had all these mental health issues and said they loved me and were much nicer. They\u2019re angry i haven\u2019t gotten better, maybe they think I\u2019m lying or attention seeking. Attention seeking for mental illness is disgusting and it insults me they probably think that. Have not trying to kill my self once already not confirmed it\u2019s not a joke and that I\u2019m not lying? I did it because I was in pain, i don\u2019t really understand people. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the pain I will cause everybody\u2019s and as I won\u2019t be able to tell them that, I want to write it out.i might regret my decision when I\u2019ve just done it but isn\u2019t that normal? Why would you want to experience severe temporary pain and know there\u2019s no turning back. Your brain and mind will obviously go into crisis mode and the survival instincts will kick in because you\u2019re brain will want to protect you from severe harm. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t truly want to die, it just means that suicide is so difficult, painful and never an easy decision to make but that your brain and survival responses aren\u2019t in line with everyday you.\n\nThat would upset anyone but doesn\u2019t negate the fact of how much pain you were in before and how you couldn\u2019t cope.  I am sorry though. I\u2019m not one for leaving notes, I don\u2019t think it helps and people could become obsessed with the note in some way. If I survive tomorrow then I will have not had the strength which make sense as I am weak unfortunately. \n\nIf I had supportive parents, a friend who went out of their way to help me and make me feel comfortable or a girl who made me feel loved I wouldn\u2019t be writing this. This saddens me and I have exerted all my energy finding it. I almost had it but was too good to be true, losing multiple things after being cheated on. Referencing GoT \u2018I fought, I lost, now I rest\u2019\n\nGoodbye all, please be kind and nice to others. I always tried to make people who weren\u2019t noticed or shy come out their shell and introduced them to people. I was blessed to have good enough confidence and social skills eventually. I was blessed me tall, blonde and relatively attractive. I appreciated all these things. I cry when I\u2019m feeling like this and have no one to at least comfort me. If someone has that, it can change everything. I know that from experience:) If this is my final sentence I ever type, then I want to use it by praying and hoping everyone reading this and everyone I love continues to be hopeful and gets better if they are struggling. \n\ntl;dr: 50/50 chance I die tomorrow",

I relapsed and started hurting myself again. I've been having a really hard time suppressing the urge to make myself vomit and even caved in a couple times. I feel like I'm being used, lied to, and don't matter to anybody around me. I don't belong anywhere I go or with any of the people I know. I feel like an outsider and outcast from society itself.  \nI NEEDED to talk to her, when I lay down at night I can only think of how much better it would be if I just gave up, if I just became a decoration, like a chandelier hanging from the ceiling.   \nI just can't wait any longer and it's gonna be really hard not to hurt myself anymore until our next appointment.",

She was stern with me about getting help and I know I can be very stubborn about some things. She\u2019s right though, I do need help whether I like it or not. That appointment was... interesting. Honestly in the waiting room I felt like I was just going to start crying at points. That\u2019s not like me at all. This isn\u2019t me. When I got out of the appointment, I felt different though. I felt much more at ease. Exhausted since I slept maybe 2 or 3 hours, but I didn\u2019t feel as... hopeless. Even though I\u2019m not excited for it, I\u2019m trying to get therapy of some sorts again, as soon as possible.\n\nI know I still don\u2019t feel well. I know it\u2019s going to take time to get better again.

Ends up always playing alone after many years of mmo experience, the bridges never seem to formulate or stick around. Guess I may as well try to play alone and have little to no progression.. Kinda like life. \n\n* Maybe I could boot up some No Mans Sky or some shit. Explore the galaxy - as a lone Interloper. \n\n* Want to see the new avengers movie? Oh right.. Yeah, everyone else already made their plans with other friends and/or significant others.\n\n* Who are you gonna hang out with this weekend? Could you just call up a friend and be able to hang out at a park or something? What's that... Oh, right, one of your 'friends' has plans with their significant other as usual, and the other is miles away doing things with his significant other. Guess I'll just.. Chill alone, at home, and play some games...\n\n* I guess I could take a walk.. Alone. \n\n* Ah yeah, that nice girl you've been speaking to recently, maybe you could spend some time talking to her? Or maybe hang out. Oh yeah.. She has no interest in making conversation unless you're willing to force it on your part whilst she claims to find you interesting. Two days without talking because you didn't want to be the only one making an effort.\n\n* I guess I'll chill in my discord server and maybe someone will wanna play something or chat... 3 hours later... Still alone in channel. *disconnect*\n\n* How many days can you go without anyone even remotely trying to reach out to you and talk to you? Too long for sure, does anyone even legitamately see you at this point? Maybe I'm just invisible and aren't aware I have this awesome power. Or nobody gives a fuck? Nobody gives a fuck. \n\n* Considering you don't have anyone else to talk to, why don't you make a post to reddit where it'll either go completely unnoticed like yourself in life most the time, or some individuals feeling a similar way will relate and try to say something nice whilst fully well knowing that it's only a temporary aid to both themselves and the person posting, but yet there's still some sort of solace in the relatability of it.\n\n* You remember that time recently where you told 2 of your family members in an outburst that you feel like jumping off a bridge and brought up the fact you're taking anti depressants and neither batted an eye or took the time to talk to you about it after the fact? Nice.\n\nThe trend? Being alone. Bloody wonderful isn't it, not really.\n\nHi, I'm some dumbass nerd struggling with anxiety and depression who is trying to improve in life yet still seems to find himself alone all the time. This individual is about to spend all weekend after work on my own again for the 999999millionty-eth time, can't even get high cause of these damn anti depressants so huzzah, rejoice.",

            "selftext": "\nMy entire life she has called me a quitter because I quit sports teams as a child. My entire life she has used example from 7+ years ago, prompting me to not pursue what I want to do. Then she\u2019ll turn around and say \u201cyou need to get involved in things\u201d but when I do find something she says I\u2019ll just quit it. I finally found something I wanted to do today, that I said I\u2019d save up for and she went \u201cwhy? you\u2019re just gonna quit it and lose $5,000 like always.\u201d There\u2019s not a single activity that I\u2019ve done the past seven years, but every small activity at school/work I\u2019ve completed and stuck with. Even though I cry about work and complain about how I want to quit (obviously I\u2019m not I just need to vent) she takes it seriously and tried to use that as an example. I left public school and went to a two day a week charter  due to wanting to get a job and find myself, she also used that as an example of times I \u201cquit\u201d. Why would I quit a school when I\u2019m doing academically well? Whenever I\u2019m sobbing or upset she guilts me into silence. She\u2019ll say \u201cI spend all night worrying about you\u201d \u201cI cry over you everyday\u201d. Every time I\u2019m upset it basically just script at this point for her to talk about her being upset/mad that I\u2019m crying. She only talks about herself and uses her disease as an excuse for her being an empathetic mother (she has MS). I get she\u2019s in pain but I need someone to support me once and a while. Honestly, the only reason I try to like her at this point is because she\u2019s related to me and helped me survive the past 17 years. Every time I\u2019m upset she claims I\u2019m on my period. I\u2019ve told her so many times the past four years I\u2019m depressed and she has yet to get me professional help even though I\u2019ve asked for it.  I honestly feel like how she treats me is borderline abusive. If I call her out on it she screams at me and tells me she\u2019s doing nothing wrong. I\u2019m sick of going crazy here thinking I\u2019m the lazy quitter she keeps telling me I am. She really only cares about my dad, she does everything and anything for him but if I ask for something she acts like it\u2019s such a big fucking deal. She won\u2019t let me get my license, but complains whenever she has to drive me somewhere (I don\u2019t live by a bus stop). Sorry if I\u2019m carrying on, I\u2019m so upset right now. What lead this on was my interest in a summer program at New York Film Academy. I asked her to post on her Facebook account (she has all the neighbors/family friends/ family members added, I don\u2019t even have a Facebook) that I will be doing yard work/babysitting if needed because I\u2019m attempting to save up for the academy. She made a big deal about it and said I was just going to waste my money and that I was begging for money. She told me that I\u2019m not working for what I want. I\u2019m pretty sure doing yard work, babysitting, selling all my name brand clothes I\u2019ve bought with my own money, and still continuing to work full time IS working for what I want. Im just so frustrated. I wish at least one person in my life supports me. It feels so impossible because everyone\u2019s mother is supposed to be that one person, I feel so alone and unlucky.",

The sadness is starting to get replaced by anger, at this point it's good to feel something else. I'd have my good days where nothing happens and I'm doing alright and then BOOM I say something stupid, do something stupid, fucking break something.

I can\u2019t stop crying, I keep breaking down out of no where and it\u2019s getting in the way of being able to function. I had a break down Monday night because of an influx of school work, being anxious that my depression this whole semester is going to stop me from passing classes during my second to last semester, not being able to find a job when there are expensive things ahead, and going through so much with my partner that I\u2019m not equipped to deal with right now. I woke up Tuesday thinking I got my tears all out &amp; I can push through, but quickly after I woke up that morning my worst nightmare happened. My dog was bitten by a rattlesnake and I truly did not think he was going to make it. After days of crying, he was able to barely pull through and is home with me now. \nI can\u2019t get out of bed without crying, leaving my house to go to class or work on essays is beyond me right now. I was even so excited a few weeks ago to start working on embroidery as a new hobby, but I just got all of my stuff yesterday and it seems so unappealing. I keep comparing myself to everything and everyone else too. I don\u2019t know how to hold it together and scary thoughts have been creeping in. Ones that I know I don\u2019t feel but because I\u2019m in the fog I \u201cthink\u201d I want. \nI just feel so drained, lonely &amp; pathetic for not being able to handle all of this. \nThank you for anyone that read this whole thing. I\u2019m gonna really try to push myself to leave the house now.",

            "selftext": "Ok I was on a university excursion a few weeks ago for a week. It was good however I had a really bad depressive and suicidal spike on the trip. I tried to be as happy as possible and hide it however spending majority of the day with them and hiding it and pretending to be fine takes the toll on someone. So one night what was the worst night for me I had a really down period felt worthless and suicidal but still had to hang around with them. One of my friends noticed I was down and was texting his friend saying I was emotionally draining. I saw the text and felt even shitter. A week after the trip has finished I apologised for being a bit down (under exaggerating it) to the friend and he said it was fine. Looking back at it I don\u2019t know I feel like I just shouldn\u2019t have apologised for it. Since the trip I\u2019ve started taking medication.",

When i came back i saw a wild cat we feed daily in front of our door step. But it was late at night which i found very unusual. After feeding it, i tried to pet it and i realized it was more alarmed and aggressive than usual. After a bit i ask my sister if anything happened while i was gone. She told me that yesterday after the came back at the afternoon from a restaurant they found a dead kitten in front our door step. I realized that it must have been the wild cat's kitten, since she used to be fatter the last time i saw her. Now she is still in front of our house. And i feel so guilty for not being able to do anything. i tried to see if she would take me to see her other kittens if she had any, but she seems to only stand still. I honestly don't know what to do and feel pretty guilty, since i love animals as much as i love breathing :( P.S: i haven't asked my dad yet on what he did to the dead kitten. But if i had to guess he probably got rid of it.",

In my country we start highschool when we're 12. The same year I started highschool my parents divorced and had horrible fights in where they called eachother horrible things. I was very affected by this and I ended up failing my first subject since I was 7. This caused me a lot of stress but I ended up going threw the year somewhat fine. The next year is when things really started to go badly. I started having suicidal thoughts almost every day, meanwhile, my country was having an economic crisis and my parents were very stressed. The economic crisis also started when me and my mom were moving to a new home since we couldn't afford to maintain the old one. My grades were significantly lower than last year's and I became addicted to my phone and I everything started feeling bland and boring. I started pretending everything was fine but eventually this caused me to have mental breakdowns when I heard my parents fighting on the phone. I once told me dad that I wanted to kill myself but this didn't go anywhere. I ended up nearly failing 3 subjects that year but i had 2 wonderful teachers that helped me and I only failed 1. That year I moved houses twice. I started crying when I moved into my final \"permanent\" house in late 2018 because I missed my old one. Everything seemed to go bad even when my summer break arrived. I once tried to put a plastic bag over my head but it didn't work. I started this year pretty good, and with better grades. Then everything just fell down and I feel suicidal once again. I'm still not sure if I actually am depressed or not and thinking I'm just an idiot faking it makes me feel any worse. Please help me, how do I get out of this situation?",

I dont know how to explain it, I hope somebody understands and relates to what I'm saying... \n\nWhatever the reason above, I wish my building was on fire just so I could have a good excuse for jumping off the top story. I'm really struggling here and it's a month till I see my psychiatrist to see if it's right for me",

            "selftext": "Long-ish.  \n\n\nI'm not sure what I expect to get out of this, but I have a lot to say, and I don't want to annoy the people I know with it. \n\nI'm suicidal. I don't recall ever not being suicidal. The first time I told someone, I was 12. I've self abused since I was 8, or at least that's the earliest I can recall. It may have been earlier. I'd not cut myself, I'd just punch myself. My thighs, typically, as that would easily be covered by clothing and I didn't want anyone to see the bruises I had left. However, one time my mom did notice. She mentioned it to me and asked where I had gotten the bruises. I told her that my step mom had abused me. Looking back on it, she never believed me. She still let me go to my dads and never questioned my dad about it. And I know she cared about me, so it wasn't that she just didn't care if I was being abused. She knew I did it myself, she just had no idea how to handle it.  \n\n\nPhysical self abuse still happens on a regular basis, which I'm embarrassed to admit. I'm in my 20s and I'm physically beating myself up as if I'm a kid throwing a tantrum. For the most part, however, the physical abuse turned to mental abuse. I told myself all the things that I'm sure all of you reading this have said to yourself. You know, things like how worthless you are, how no one loves you, you're a failure and you've never done anything, so on and so forth. It ruins your self worth.  \n\n\nI have trouble making friends as a result, it's quite easy to think that if I don't like myself, then clearly no one else could. I've tried making friends and have failed at it miserably. However, I do have 3 friends, I'm not sure how I got them, but they're there. I suppose I just sort of fell into those friendships. I realize I'm lucky in that regard.   \n\n\nI'm lucky in so many ways. I had a good home life and upbringing and I have family and friends that love me. All of my friends have it worse, and they're all in better shape mentally than I am. But I'm the one crying myself to sleep most nights because I'm sick of feeling so lonely. I'm the one crossing the street at night without looking and just hoping in the back of my mind that there's a truck coming. I'm lonely but not alone. I know my friends love me They've all said as much, and their actions all indicate that they're not saying it just to say it. So why don't I feel anything when they say it? I never have. Not from my parents, not from my friends, and especially not from myself. What the hell is wrong with me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI worry constantly that the few friends that I do have will get sick of me being so down all the time. I've opened up to them, and they are supportive. Again, I'm so lucky. It's not right of me to lay all of my problems at their feet, that's why I'm posting here. I get jealous constantly if one of them does something without me. My brain just automatically goes to thinking they don't like me and that I've pushed them away. That they finally saw in me what I see in myself and they're done with me. I know logically that this isn't the case, but I'm fighting a losing battle. The more I fight against the idea, the harder this voice in the back of my head fights back. It's exhausting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's where the suicidal thoughts come in. I don't want to die, I just want to stop feeling tired, sad, anxious, or jealous all the time. I just want to experience some positive emotion on a semi frequent basis. The last time I could say I felt genuinely happy was in 2014. If I could have a good day, like once a week or once every 2 weeks, that'd be nice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there's a bright side, it's that I finally decided to get help, and my first therapy session is in a week. I have no idea how I'm even going to phrase these things to someone. Even as I write this, it all sounds so pathetic. So trivial.  Hopefully it helps. It has to, because if it doesn't then I'm surely out of options.",

I go to a really selective and prestigious boarding school and there is very high pressure for me to do well. I'm expected to get straight A/A\\*s in these exams and was supposed to revise over the past 3 week holiday. But typical for me I just sat around depressed and procrastinated. Most people at my school did like 7 hours a day, I did around 1. I'm just really fucking depressed about it cos as usual I've fucking let myself down and my family. These are major exams that set me up for the rest of my life and I've just fucked them up. I've got my French speaking exam tomorrow and I haven't prepared shit for it. Now I'll be up all night cramming with little end result. The 25 exams I have, there is so much content I know jack all about and it too fucking late to do anything about it. \n\nHonestly I feel so shit inside, Ive really betrayed my parents, I lied all holidays to them about how much revision I was doing and I get really aggressive whenever they try to talk to me about it. Ive ruined a great opportunity and privilege Ive had in life and was too lazy to commit a few weeks of my life for my future. \n\nIve got to the point where I think, wtf can I do about it, theres not much time left and so much to cover. My grandparents both have cancer and is this really how to repay them for all they've done, they pay for my school and my siblings', and Ive fucked up the opportunity they given me, and Im gonna leave them with the memory of me screwing them over.",

I cant stop thinking about how much of a fuck up I am, I cant let the small mistakes go. \n\nIve been quick to anger, lashing out at people and no matter what I do I just seem to make things worse. And all this has been building for a few months now. \n\nI just want it to stop. I cant put my family through me self harming, not that it hasnt crossed my mind. About how easy and definitive of a solution that would be, even if its not a real option.\n\nIve been thinking about heading to the er and letting a professional figure it out, but I dont want to waste their time, and take away from someone who really needs their help.\n\nWhat scares me, on top of everything else, is I'm in the national guard. We are headed to the range tomorrow. I dont know if I trust myself. \n\nI just dont know. I just want to stop feeling this way, to care about things again.

I brain washed myself into thinking that happiness is driven by the fact that I am not good enough right now, and when I accomplish the goals I set for myself, I will finally think myself as good enough. But of course that's not true, and that idea finally hit me today. However, that's a bit of an issue as all my happiness TODAY stems from the fact that Im chasing something that will bring me happiness in the FUTURE. But honestly, nothing will change. No matter what I do, my core self will only be dictated by my self talk, and how much I take care of my body/give my biology what it wants (eating, sleeping, exercising, sex).  \nWhat I'm asking here is if this is true, then what's the point of trying to accomplish anything if I'll end up just as happy as when I started? I feel like the only time I am happy is when I create a problem that causes so much pain that it gives me so much pleasure to solve it. \nIDK what to do now. What to go for.",

            "selftext": "I've been feeling particularly blue the last few weeks since I quit smoking pot (wasn't doing me any favors long term) and when I was going through my things I came across a book my last therapist recommended to me: Feeling Good The New Mood Therapy. It's basically the primer on CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy. I got it maybe a year ago on his recommendation but never touched it because I was so convinced I would never get better. This time I started reading it and applying the techniques and for the first time in what feels like years, I'm beginning to remember what happiness feels like. \n\nI won't go into the theory too much, but the exercise I've been doing for the past week involves writing down all the negative, self-defeating thoughts I have during the course of the day. Then you label the \"cognitive distortion\" (type of negative thought) associated with that thought and come up with a rational response to it that rebuts the knee jerk negative thought. It seems so simple and stupid that it couldn't possibly be effective (the book even predicts you'll have that initial thought) but it actually works. One of my frequent negative thoughts is \"no one likes me or wants to talk to me because I'm an asshole.\" According to a handy list of cognitive distortions the book provides this is an example of the mind reading error. The response I come up with is \"How can I possibly know what other people are thinking? Maybe telepathy exists but it's not an ability I have. If I'm easygoing and friendly, I'm sure someone will be willing to have a conversation with me.\" \n\nI was in my university's language lab today trying to get some last minute lab hours for my Spanish class when two people at my table started talking about how stupid the kanji system is for describing numbers. I wanted to ask why, but that same negative thought popped into my head. Today, however, instead of keeping my mouth shut and reading my book, I decided to ask the girl in front of me why it was so stupid. I fully expected her to snarl at me and tell me to leave them alone since the final is next week, but I kept my response in mind and asked. It led to a very informative explanation as to why kanji are so bad at describing numbers and it turned into a conversation about what we both wanted to do with our lives after graduating. We wound up talking for a good forty-five minutes before my class started and I had to leave. Before I left she smiled and said, \"It was nice talking to you. I hope you do something with your idea for a novel, it sounds interesting.\" \n\nOf course, my first thought was \"She doesn't mean that, she's just being nice. Why did you talk to her you weirdo?\" But then I remembered, I'm not a telepath, I can't read minds. The only way I can tell what she's thinking is by what she says to me. And she said she enjoyed talking to me. If she didn't want to talk to me, she could have said so at any time and I would have left her alone. But she didn't. Therefore, she wanted to and enjoyed talking to me. Hence, I'm not an asshole. \n\nThis is how CBT works, it trains you to recognize distorted depressive thoughts and counter them rationally. Today was the first time I applied the technique in real time and, Io and behold, nothing bad happened. I had a nice conversation with someone who I otherwise would never have bothered. \n\nIt felt good talking to someone else for the first time in what feels like forever. It makes me wonder what other lies my depression is telling me. Maybe I'm not a hopeless, irredeemable, unattractive loser who doesn't deserve to feel happy and complete. Maybe I just have an insidious disease that's poisoned and distorted my thoughts and self-perceptions to the point where I believe the worst of myself and others. Maybe there's hope for me. \n\nIn any case, at least I now know that there's one person whose day was improved by interacting with me. And that's one more person than I ever believed existed.",

I do have people that i consider friends and some i consider my second family, people i would do anything for, but it feels like they want me as a friend and brother only when it suits their needs... I for one would be ready to do anything for them and never refused a favor, but when i find myself needing their support i just the usual \"it gets better, it won't be like this forever, i'm here for you\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNever had a girlfriend either so far, whenever i try i just end up hurting and/or growing apart from the other party even if we were friends before. And frankly i hate this. I'm sick of hurting people i care enough about to want them in my life forever, i'm sick of trying and failing, i'm sick of getting the \"i don't want to ruin our friendship\" but ending up not even talking to each other in the end....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be honest i got quite a lot better since attending college, but also a lot worse. Before i never really had people that i could call real friends, but after having them and considering them so, when i feel betrayed by them it also hurts a whole lot more....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest example of this would be this girl that i got really close with, basically became brother and sister at this point, we both treasure each other, i truly love her more than anything else in the world right now, not romantically, but i honestly want to be able to stay by her side for the rest of my life, as long or short as it may be, and really wish nothing but happiness for her. But that isn't to say she is perfect, no. Right now she is the one making me the happiest but also the one hurting me the most. I get happy when she calls me for a walk, but i get depressed when she cancels it (2 times she called me out, 2 times she canceled it), i get happy when i see her and her boyfriend getting along, but i also get sad from being the third wheel, i get happy when she spends time with her best friend, but i also get sad because she doesn't do the same with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, lately we've been arguing quite a lot, mostly because my insecurities keep getting the best of me and wanting her to realize what i need and want her to do, but as you may have guessed, it doesn't really go well. I just feel that it's pointless if i need to tell her that i'm mad at her for something she did, or that i just want to hear \"i love you bro\" when i'm feeling down and suicidal again....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe honestly isn't the brightest person generally speaking, and a bit of an air-head, so i don't think she does those things on purpose, but with how i am it just ends up being a huge deal for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly i feel a bit sad now and a bit suicidal still, just had a fight with her because of the things i just mentioned above. But honestly, the real reason is that i'm scared. I'm scared that she doesn't need me anymore, that now that she has her best friend and her lover, she won't need me to be by her side anymore. And it hurts more than anything else i've felt so far. I've finally found someone that i felt that genuinely cared about me, maybe she doesn't know how to show it the best way, or how to get me out of my mood swings, but i honestly felt that for once someone would miss me if i suddenly disappeared. And this feeling of not being needed anymore, of not having a role to play in her life anymore, of being replaced, it hurts me the most out of anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read this long, thank you for hearing a little bit of my story. I want you to know that even if can't say it gets easier or better, i believe in you, i believe you have the strength to keep going. You will find the people you deserve, and they won't let you go.",

            "selftext": " Probably gonna just finally drop out for good this semester. I mean I'm failing all my classes, so I'm probably gonna get kicked out anyways. I'm not motivated to go to class anymore or even study for my finals. I hate my major and I just can't seem to focus in my classes. I've switched majors like 3 times now and I'm still unhappy. I also feel as fuck going to school. I'm pretty dumb and the only reason I made it this far was because I cheated in some of my classes and also did the bare min to get by in the other classes. I know **I fucked up**. **This is 100% my fault.** I'm fucking dumb for wasting all this time and money. Tbh I just go to school so it doesn't seem like im a complete failure. My mom still thinks I'm gonna graduate and its gonna kill her when she finds out that I'm gonna pretty much get kicked out. I feel like a fucking worthless dumb fuck. I kept telling people that I'm almost done with school, even though I'm not. I'm so fucking behind in my studies. I tried to push myself, but I just can't do this anymore. I need to get an internship in order to graduate and since my grades are shit, I don't think I'll be getting any internships  \n\n\nNot sure what I'm gonna do now. I mean I guess I could go back to working as a bartender for a while. I guess I could learn a trade, even though I don't want to. I guess I could also get some BS IT cert online and just work my way up to some \"high lvl\" job.   \n\n\nI just hope I can turn it around before I turn 30. I'm 25, so I guess I have some time left. I've been told that I'm young as fuck, but tbh I feel like a fucking boomer. Sorry for the shitty blog. I just had to get that off my chest. I hope everything works out for you guys.",

I\u2019m lost of who to turn too in my state of mind. I don\u2019t know how to express the pain I\u2019ve been hiding inside that\u2019s taken a drastic impact on my mental and physical health. This semester I haven\u2019t tried my hardest to improve academically because I was always going places for not only networking but also to get away from college campus for as long as possible. Looking back, I lost in touch with mostly everyone from my fraternity to organizations whom I thought I could maintain friendships regardless of whether/not I was involved enough. The main reason was I built a wall around my heart because a long time ago I let somebody inside from taking her to horse races to basketball games. I even asked her out to my fraternity\u2019s formal that she accepted but like a fool who overthought the idea of a compassionate relationship, she ditched me to carpool with someone else to the designated venue. Even though I asked my brothers for a spot in their cars, it turns out there wasn\u2019t enough room to give me a lift. Instead I drove by myself 4 hours there and back to get formal over with rather than stay behind dreading the humiliation. Things went from bad to worse that even my roommate/fraternity brother stole my food, towels, and maybe even money out of my wallet without permission. After a fight one night, I moved out and lived out of my truck for a month until summer came that I transferred schools. \n\nIn reflection on this semester, I wasted too much time and energy into ideal projects with the thought they could excel with common interest. Yet no one has come forward or just don\u2019t give a damn because of my character to be emotionally stubborn. I try too hard to impress people when I think I\u2019m funny but not; or lose track of conversation with points of empty thought in awkwardness. So as a result I\u2019ve been eating more than I should and sleeping less than ever with the empty hole in my heart as much as the looming thought that I\u2019m already feeling like a failure in everyone\u2019s eyes from my parents to everyone I pushed away due to my urge of trying hard to impress anyone I come into contact with. Having said that, I\u2019ve lost that motivation and fire to see why I should keep trying anymore with such dark thoughts. At this point I see it\u2019s better off that I didn\u2019t exist in the first place that way no one would have to deal with my sensitivity, silence through introversion,  the constant mistake of letting people down, persistent state of mind for ideas, and the fact I always assume the bad always takes course in any situation I place a lot of hope into. God has a plan for everyone, my only question is when is He going to decide to end my time and help me rid of this suffering.",

            "selftext": "So this is my second medication I've tried and its seems to do the trick so far. I would usually be fighting my thoughts and struggling to keep a clear mind which would just drag me deeper into my mind and bring out anxiety attacks and other sorts that would just mentally cripple me. This medication I believe is calming all that down now! I still have the thoughts, but they don't bother me as much or interfer with my day as they did in the past. The only problem I have now is that I still can't enjoy doings things I used to like doing by myself like drawing and reading. I'll pick up a book or pencil and start doing it, but then don't find any enjoyment out it at all. I mean I like the thought that I finished whatever it I was doing, but I didn't enjoy doing it if that makes sense. I just want to lay in bed all day and browse reddit and YouTube until I find something to do with my friends. Maybe it just takes time for my personal interests to develop again? If anybody else has been in the same situation I'd love to hear your story!\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this",

Recently I've been doing pretty good I've told some of my friends about my crush and they got really pumped and encouraged me to ask her out Im really glad they think we could be a cute couple. I didn't ask her out lol not yet. Anyway I always walk with her to her bus and today this eighth grader went in between us and like put his arms on both of our shoulders and then like rubbed her head. This made me kinda upset obviously because I have feelings for her.. so yeah. But because of this I didn't get to give her a goodbye hug. And I know that's a small problem and there are people that have it muchhhhh worse than me it still hurt. I just.. I'm worried to this guy has  dated a lot of 7th graders and one 6th grader and like finger bangs them so I'm just like hoping she's not gonna end up with that fucking idiot. Sorry again for this I contemplated posting this but I thought it was important to say how much little things can affect us. Humans are very fragile. Thanks for reading this guys.",

I know it's just my narrative, but it's like she was perfect. For me anyway.\nOne night a few weeks after she started I was leaving work with a cart load of groceries and who knows what when she offered to help.. \nI use a wheelchair and I absolutely detest when people assume I can't do something or that I'm going to need their help for basic stuff.. so of course I tried to make some stupid joke and when that went over like a lead balloon I just accepted the help. At the end of it all I didn't have the courage to ask for her phone number. But I gave her mine. I was so surprised a few days later when she messaged me. And even more so when she let me take her out. We started dating and it was amazing. ( at least for me) It had been a few months and then it started to happen. My insecurities and anxiety started to creep into my thoughts, and then she met him. And that was enough to help me to really ruin things. He was a new guy that started it the same grocery store she said he seemed nice and cool. One day she asked for his phone number. She said he seemed like a nice guy who could be a good friend. this is while we're still dating...  I was hurt and afraid but I knew I couldn't do anything but hope it wouldn't go badly.... It did... It turned out he had something I didn't.. eventually she told me she didn't want to see me in that context anymore. I suppose I didn't handle it well. Nevertheless we tried to stay friends, we spoke often and of deep things.. I tried to be an adult and be happy for my friend, but all I could feel was hurt and jealousy that she was happy without me. I even tried to move on with someone new, but all I felt was numbness. I have been thinking about my happiness for a while and how I could find it again. So yesterday when she messaged me and told me we were talking too much, I told her I agreed. I told her that it still hurt and that I didn't want to talk or hang out or anything anymore. I told her it was my fault that I couldn't be more mature but it wasn't fair to anyone for me to still feel this way towards her. \nI don't know if I did the right thing right now. But I know it hurts too much to keep seeing her like that.\nI know it's going to be hard because we both work at the same place right now, but she's changing departments and I found a new job that starts next month. I should be happy about it, more hours better pay closer to home. But still im just as numb about that as I am about anything else. I just miss her. I miss her smile and her laugh. I miss the goofy stupid little thing she would say at random.\nI'm sure it's going to be hard, but I honestly feel like this was the first step towards being happy again. Having her in my life was like having an arrow sticking out of my chest. There could be no healing and every little bump hurt...\nAnyway I think this is my first time posting in here and I'm sorry it was so long. So thanks if you took the time to read it..\nTldr I met a girl at work, my depression and anxiety scared her into the arms of another man and now I'm just trying to find a way to get over that...",

It is very clear that is not the case and being diagnosed has helped me improve by leaps and bounds.\n\nSometimes I really feel depressed and numb for an hour, sometimes for weeks. I hear that\u2019s normal for depression. But almost all my life I\u2019ve also had these INTENSE bursts of happiness. Like I\u2019ve been feeling shit about not having any real abilities even though I\u2019m a junior at a state university and I saw a reddit post about useful online certifications for your resume and I got SO excited very suddenly like my hands were kinda shaky and I couldn\u2019t stop bouncing my leg and I just wanted to tell my boyfriend and best friend and start the courses RIGHT NOW but I have work and finals and homework to do and I\u2019m literally in class right now. It took about 10 min to pass but I was frantically googling and staying super excited and now it\u2019s gone and I\u2019m just tired. \n\nIs this an OCD related thing? Like hyper focus and bursts of excitement? I get like this about a lot of things. A friend tells me she had a good interview, boom. I go nuts with excitement. 6 weeks go by and I\u2019m making a cup of coffee and boom, \u201cOMG IT\u2019S DELICIOUS I FEEL SO GOOD AND OKAY AND HAPPY AND EXCITED\u201d then it\u2019s gone. \n\nAnybody else have experienced like this?\nMy therapist says it\u2019s normal but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s very good and I\u2019m looking for another but it\u2019s only $10 per visit with her and my insurance and that\u2019s really hard to beat",

My gloomy self already assumes it is a mistake and not for me. I called reception, but no one answered. I text my husband and he gave me a short response which made me have a glimmer of hope that he was trying to be cute amd surprise me. \n\nI went WAY across the building (I work in a LARGE office) to find out that it was a mistake.

            "selftext": "I'm new here, and I looked at the rules. I'm still cautious because some subreddits have very stringent rules and I'm not sure if I'm violating any. I'm sorry if I am.  \n\n\nWhat really destroys my hope is the realization that, though I try as hard as I physically can, life never seems to get easier. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistory:\n\nI've struggled with depression my entire life. I come from an Indian family and I'm (now secretly) MTF transgender, and so that was a shitshow of abuse. The only think I took pride in was my intelligence but the constant abuse made it hard for me to get my homework done because I couldn't concentrate while my mom was yelling at me and scratching/biting me. I then developed a severe eating disorder when I was 16, and my grades in school were still okay. But then I was sent to a psyche ward and administration wouldn't let me take my honours and AP courses. So my source of pride vanished. When I was 20 I felt quite fit and attractive, thanks to the eating disorder (at the time I was starving myself constantly and I was a raw vegan, and that made me feel good about myself). No one has ever been able to tell I'm transgender by looking at me. Then I tried to kill myself because the eating disorder was essentially me abusing myself with constant fasting and vomiting if I would eat anything. I lost 70 pounds by the time I tried to kill myself with 2,4-Dinitrophenol by taking a huge dose every day for three months. It didn't kill me faster because during that whole time I was throwing up a lot for various reasons. Eventually, I nearly died and was put in the ICU by my parents. Since then I have had some autoimmune issues. My hair started to fall out due to autoimmune alopecia. This was a major blow for me because due to my gender transition, growing out my hair was  a big step for me, and I had only had long hair for three years. Alopecia generally is a life-long thing. And now I have either fibromyalgia or seronegative rheumatoid arthtritis. Post-suicide attempt, I have gained 60 pounds back, and I can't seem to shake it even with fasting (I'm a weight loss expert thanks to the ED). It's probably a hormonal thing resulting from my illness. I hate my appearance and wear black, baggy clothes, sunglasses, and gloves all the time. I entered a relationship for the first time a year ago, and my BF is very accepting of my issues but he's sick of the fact that I wear baggy, black clothes. He thinks I'm beautiful, and I know I'm hideously ugly. I could never tolerate the shame of wearing \"cute, feminine\" clothes because I refuse to defile myself like that. I'm also probably asexual (I didn't know this, but when we have tried to have sex it was extremely unpleasant for me), and it has been hard for my BF. I feel like he is going to break up with me because of these issues, and I really get it. I'm not worth anything to him. But I'm scared because since I have been with him, I have been less depressed (though still not happy). I am pre-med, and since I have been with him, my grades have returned to my usual As (they turned into Bs and Cs during my second year due to my mental health/suicide issues). I'm scared that I won't be able to manage if I don't keep using my BF to aid me. He provides emotional support and drives me to school, making it easier for me to go (my chronic illness makes walking painful, so driving me has been a big help). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, I am the cause for so many of my own problems. In my life, I can't recall I time when I was happy for more than a few minutes. Perhaps this is normal. But it doesn't look like it because I have met other people (duh), and they just don't have as many issues as me. In fact, regularly when I have made friends, if they have found out about my issues, they have stopped talking to me. I suppose it's because they don't know what to say to support me. So these days I keep everything I deal with a secret. As far as other people know, I'm a regular Indian-American woman in college. Sometimes being transgender is something I'd like to seek support for, but I can't because I keep it a secret now.   \n\n\nI'm just so hopeless. I'm not quite suicidal again; I feel like, given my high performance in school lately, I have a chance at pursuing my dreams. But I'm so scared because I don't feel like I can get through life on my own. I've only ever been in one romantic relationship, and if it ends, I don't plan to pursue another because I am such a burden. And I can't seem to find friends, though I make them easily: they leave as soon as they are aware of my issues, even if I don't tell them. I think my depression also might make me an 'energy vampire' (figuratively). I think people can tell I have a lot of problems once they get to know me and it drives them away.   \n\n\nI don't really know why I'm posting this here other than that I'm scared because I can't predict the future (who can?) and the trajectory that my life appears to be going in scares me. There's so much more but as I've already written so much, I'll just end here.",

Im 19f, and i have seen a counsler at school once, because one of my teachers said it might be a good idea. I just have this voice inside my head that tells me that nothing is wrong, and it probably just is because im young and have a lot of emotions, and that i should just stop being a fucking wuss and be happy for once. I feel so stupid because of it. And its not like i dont have any friends, i do. But everytime someone asks me if i want to hang out ---i dont want to?? I mean, I know its going to probably be okay, and i will get along and have a nice time, but it is so hard for me to actually agree to going and comitting to it.\n\nMy biggest problem right now is just that i cry all the goddamn time, and i dont have anyone to talk to it about, because no one knows about it and i really dont like talking to friends and family about serious things, because i am 100% sure that i will start crying in front of them and i really dont want that to happen. Even the school counsler said, that if i didnt tell her more, she wasent sure she could help me. what a way to make me feel stupid???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first post to reddit, what a nice place to vent.. \n\nbut back to the original question. what is wrong with me????????????????????",

            "selftext": "TL:DR - I've been feeling great but the last couple days I've been getting hit with situations that are causing my light to dim, today that light is all but extinguished. \n\nI've been struggling with remaining positive and not falling into the proverbial hole that leads into my depression. I've been trying to smile more and have been actively trying to disperse more positive energy to those around me in an effort to create a positive and loving space that I can flourish in. For the most part it's been going well! I've seen positive impacts in my personal life, my relationship with my partner and my job! \n\nEnter in Admin Professional Day - I am an Admin for a company in the US, and like most admins I was hoping my boss would say something encouraging like \"Thank you for making me look so good\" or \"Thank you\" period. But all that was waiting for me was an email to do more work. I'm thankful for my job and I know I'm a great Admin - but words of encouragement and appreciation from your boss goes a long way as well. Then realizing every other Admin in our company received some form of thanks from their bosses made me feel left out and hurt. Who wouldn't? \n\nI tried coping with it - received words of encouragement and praise from my partner and tried moving on with my day as much as possible. Still trying to maintain that positive outlook. But this morning had 2 more hits queued up and I wasn't ready for it. I have an important event this weekend to attend and had asked my partner to attend with me - this would be the first big event he would be attending of mine - as I have attended a couple of his - but rather than jumping on the opportunity as I have - he remained hesitant - which caused me to think he just doesn't want to attend. Naturally I felt hurt again thinking that although he says he wants insight into my life - he doesn't really want that. Then at work I was chastised by someone who called in for information that I didn't have at my disposal.\n\n3 hits in 2 days - I feel stressed which is causing anxiety, hurt which is causing my heart/chest to hurt (which isn't a hyperbole, my heart actually hurts) and all of this combined together is causing me to cry at my desk - unfortunately in front of coworkers who are unsure how to approach me now. And I'm sitting here thinking \"who can I talk to about this\" and no one came to mind - I don't have friends like that anymore and aside from seeing my therapist who I pay to listen to me - I have no one to just speak my mind to. Which brings me to this - this morning my light was at 80% and after the first half of this day, it's at about a 20%. I just need to hear that I'm not wrong for feeling this way and that my feelings are valid and that someone is there to listen.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI was diagnosed with depression when I was about 14 years old. I'm still depressive (at the age of 24) and I don't think that it will ever change. Depressions run in my family and it's just a \"part\" of me. \n\nOne thing that really bothers me is that no one seems to be able to truly love a depressive person. And by that I mean in a romantically way. I'm single for about 4 years now, I dated a lot of guys, but after a while they all left me, mostly because they weren't able to deal with my \"bad days\". I have a lot of good days also. I have days where I am really happy and confident, people don't even notice my depressions then and think everything is alright and that I'm just a normal, young woman. Most of my days are actually \"good days\", at least at the moment. \n\nBut on other days I spend most of the time in bed, crying, or when I try to do something else I get a panic attack. I know, it's hard to deal with this behavior and I always tried to hide it from my partners, like only going on dates when I felt good, don't tell them about my depression, don't cried in front of them, etc. But that only works for a specific time. \n\nI really ask myself why I should stay alive when there will never anybody who really loves me, the way I am. I try to fight against my depression, taking antidepressants and seeing a therapist, but that doesn't makes the depression just go away. \n\nA lot of people told me honestly, that they just can't love a depressive person and that they don't want to even try. No one wants to bother with people like me. Physically, I get a lot of compliments from men, they ask me out, message me and so on, but none of them were able to deal with me / accept me. \n\nI just want to experience true love - I want to be loved and I want to love someone back. I want a normal, healthy relationship. Love is just an very important topic in my life and knowing that I'll have to life without it makes me unbelievable sad. \n\nSo my questions for you are: do you have a relationship altough you're (or your partner is) depressive? how do you deal with depressions in a relationship? and is it even possible to find someone who really accepts you, even when you have a very depressive phase?",

I have friends, and whilst I may not be as outgoing as most, I wouldn't say I'm really that reserved. \n\nWe had mock exams back in January, and even though I barely bothered with studying, I somehow managed to get the top grades once more. My parents have always wanted me to be a doctor, so that's the path I decided to take. I know it sounds like I'm trying to show off, but without knowing this, the rest of it makes less sense.\n\nNow I face my real exams. These are the ones that will be the first part in deciding my future. But I haven't done any studying. I physically cannot sit down at my desk. My body just can't handle it. I don't really feel stressed about it, but I just don't want to care about exams. I can't even play my favourite games and enjoy them anymore. I want to leave these exams to chance, and I want my future to be completely ruined. I don't know if this me just being lazy and trying to find an excuse to give up, but I genuinely don't care, nor do I want to care. \n\nI don't have a lot of reasoning, but this is what I got so far: I don't want to die, but I want to end this life, and begin one somewhere else where maybe I can be happy. In order to end this life, I need to \"corrupt\" this life to the point where there's no choice but to \"format\" it.\n\nMy first exam is tomorrow and I've done no preparation. But I don't feel stressed. I just want to get through tomorrow so that I can spend the weekend in bed. All I've done this past month is watch anime, and now it's like the only thing that keeps me going.\n\nMy parents will be disappointed. I know it already, since they've told me to make sure I get absolutely the top grades. Even now after thinking about it, I'm not even sure if I have the energy to pursue a new life. I just want to stay in bed and not care about anything. I don't know what to even do. I've tried talking to the school counsellor, but they're absolutely useless, and just makes me get so much more angry. I make up conversations in my head, asking the right questions I need to be asked to help me calm down. But I still feel helpless. A part of me wants to be helped, but I don't have the effort to actually do anything. Which is why I'd rather just leave everything and give up with life.",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nHas anyone else struggled constantly with trying to force yourself to feel something? The other day, my friend was asking for advice and I gave him my thoughts, but then I switched it telling him he can do the opposite as well... he told me my advice was unhelpful as it was contradictory, which I understand... but I got kind of mad as well because who the hell is to stay what is right and wrong anyway? I feel like society is so beyond fucked right now. The presidency of Donald trump made me lose faith in humanity substantially I know it sounds stupid but it just damn is... \n\nI feel like everyday I have to force myself to feel something. I told my friend he shouldn't take advice from me right now because I feel fucked up. I don't know what it is. I feel so detached from my work, I feel so detached from my friends - my sister is currently going through a divorce and I don't care... I love these people obviously, and I used to love my job - but lately everything just feels the same. I'm not happy. I'm not sad. I'm in the middle. Sometimes, somedays, some weeks... I feel nothing at all. I feel most happy when I am at home creating art honestly. It gives me a feeling of accomplishment. \n\nMy job however, drains me. By the time it comes to the weekend I'm just so happy to be away from work I don't have the motivation to do anything but I have to FORCE myself because I know if I don't i'll be more fucked in the end... biking..exercising.. but still - I still feel incredibly empty after these activities. I'm proud I've done them, but then thats it - i'm back to that feeling. I'm finding it normal to constantly be dreaming of suicide and feeling nothing towards it all. \n\nIt scares me. How do I deal with this feeling of emptiness? I feel like I've lost something, but I have no idea where it is and where I left it. Some days I am happy... but mostly I'm finding I'm sad. I don't do therapy, or counselling... but I really think I should. I smoke marijuana, but I've cut back substantially over the last few months... like from smoking a joint everyday to smoking a few puffs every third or once a week kind of thing... I should just cut it out entirely. I don't drink at all. Drinking makes me go from 0 -100000 in my depression level so i've cut it out entirely... am I alone here?",

            "selftext": "To the very person who is reading this:\n\nThis is gonna be a shit ton of me rambling. I am pretty much writing what's on my mind. You can call this venting I guess. If you value your time I suggest you don't read this.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou know that feeling, when you talk to someone, and you feel their very feeling?\n\nMaybe not their exact feeling, but, you feel something while talking to them? \n\nA lot of the time, this feeling is blunt. I don't know if this is an exact feeling, but this is the best description I have for it, I guess. You feel like you are talking to yourself. Like your words are silently echoing in the non existant abyss, which is the other persons attention.\n\nDo you not want to listen to my words? Are they of no interest to you? What am I, then? What am I to you? Do you understand me? Am I understandable? Or, maybe you just don't care instead? \n\nWhy do you make me feel so empty? Do you not care about what I feel? If you don't, why do you not say it? Just tell me that you aren't interested in anything I have to say.\n\nI mean, I probably deserve it, though. I am pretty selfish if that's what I think, right? You can't read minds, so why do I feel like you should understand everything I am feeling? You can't understand. Even if I told you, would you understand? Would you want to understand? Would you think I am weird? Surely, going on about what I feel when I talk to you isn't going to be your number one concern. It's going to seem weird, infact.\n\nThis annoying kid that you know, that you talk to for whatever reason, talking to you about his thoughts about your human interactions with him. Just deciding to open up to you, for what seems like almost no reason. What a weird guy, right? Like, what does he want from me? Does he not understand, that I have my own problems, aswell?\n\nI think that I am a bad person. What worth do I have? What am I measured by, as a human? As a \"friend\"? As a family member?\n\nWhat am I measured by? What unit is there, that measures a persons worth? Am I measured for how good I am, as a person? Am I measured for how much things in different aspects I contributed to earth?\n\nIf so, is the unit goodness? Kindness? Is this unit a divine factor, that we made up? Like good or evil? In this case, who judges us in life? Do others judge us? Is their judgement worth my attention, or caring?\n\nIs our judgement the crucial factor in ones worth?\n\nAre we really one? And if there is judgement in life, what happens in death? Is there anything in death? Personally, I doubt. Still, are we really one? \n\nI feel so different at times. From day to day I feel different. Not even changed, just...different. Do I have one consciousness? Am I insane?\n\nI mean, if I am insane, if this is what being insane is, if this is what it feels like, then everybody is insane. Just not as insane as relatively \"truly\" insane people.\n\nIf we are all insane, does it even matter? If it does, to what extent? Very little, probably. What even matters? Infact, does anything matter? Does me feeling bad because I feel misunderstood in a small conversation, at a random time during the day matter? Matter to me, or anyone? Should it even matter?    \n.    \n.    \n.    \n.    \nYou. The person that reached this part of this boring shit show. Why? \n\nSurely, I do not interest you, right? If so, what are you doing here? Did you just scroll down? Randomly see what is here? Although, you must have scrolled quite a bit to get here. Bravo, then. I still doubt it, though.\n\nMaybe you're just bored. But, how bored can you be to read...well, this? I am pretty sure that are a LOT of better things you can do.\n\nI'll finish. No one cares. Even if I say what's most meaningful to me.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMe.",

Was already fighting with mood blues due to increased workload at home and school. Got very harsh feedback early in the semester which threw me into true depression. This blunted my brain and my learning. Constantly got negative feedbacks and criticism throughout the semester. No one followed up on me and I didn\u2019t reach out either. I felt disconnected, isolated, alone, guilty and numb. My husband is the smartest and most loving person I know. I was nervous about telling my husband because I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. But he did something sweet and opened this whole story about him that I had some idea about but very little. He told me that he also suffered from depression and failed classes when he was in school. He showed me his transcript which he had not ever looked at himself. He dropped one whole semester and it got worst after his father passed. He said that this is the best time for me to tell you about my past. He told me that when he was at his lowest, I came into his life and everything turned around. Now it's his turn to do the same. Nothing crazy but one of the most precious moments of my life.",

            "selftext": "Ever since I was a teenager I was the awkward kid. My friends used to joke that I hated being 1 on 1 with any person, and they would try to avoid that happening at all costs. They weren't wrong, I hate being alone with one other person. I don't know what to say or do, so I always over or under compensate. I'll either be way to open or way to silent, I can't ever seem to find a good middle ground with people. I had one friend who for years put up with my openness, and I thought we were close, but he had to move away for a job and we lost contact. \n\nTo be honest he wasn't even that great of a friend, but he was my only friend. Really the only other person I talked to. He once told me that when me and him were alone, and we weren't doing anything (watching something, playing something ect.) that he felt like he wanted to die. He didn't really specify why, but he just essentially out of nowhere begged me to \"put something on\" because being around me was depressing him so much he felt like death. I don't hate him for being honest with me. I just hate myself.\n\nAnother time I was in my room and my ex roommate asked me to come out into the kitchen to hang out with some of his friends who I didn't know. I was obviously uncomfortable as I'm rarely in social situations, but one of the 2 girls who I didn't know started saying that she suddenly felt really bad, like she was \"dead inside.\" Exactly like my friend said. She started saying this soon after I had came out of my room. \n\nI didn't do anything either time, but just my presence is so awkward and draining that people notice it. I don't think the 2nd time the girl realized it was my fault, but I know it was. I've never been comfortable around other humans at all. It gives me the feeling that a spotlight is on me and a huge crowd of people is watching me, even if it's only one person.\n\nI don't want to be a neet, leech or loser but I have never in my life had the social skills to be around others, and when I try people literally feel like death because *I feel like death myself.*",

            "selftext": "NOTE: before y'all get worried, I'm not actively planning on doing anything to myself, because I know I'm out of my gourd right now and the meds and therapy haven't taken effect yet.  But anyway, this is how I've been feeling:\n\nI've heard that lot of suicidal people feel unloved, or feel that they are a burden to their loved ones, and their loved ones would be better off without them.  I don't feel that way at all.  I know that my family loves me, my friends care deeply about me, and they would all be devastated by my passing.  But here's the catch: I...Don't...Care.\n\nI don't care that it would probably worsen my mom's depression, or give my healthy dad and younger brother a sudden emotional crisis.  I don't care that I might be the sole cause of all my friends suddenly needing therapy.  Because I wouldn't be around to see any of it.  It's not my problem.\n\nI'm a hedonist, with no life goals other than personal pleasure.  And when pleasure is outweighed by exhaustion (which has been most of the time lately), I don't want to be alive.  The thing is, I don't regret my life.  I'm nearly 30, and I've already accomplished almost everything I truly wanted out of life.  I've traveled the world, I've created art, I've been in love.  Every job I've had has made the world a better place, from working with renewable energy to working with abused animals - and I never enjoyed any of it.  I don't want to die because I've hated my life, but because I feel like I've lived long enough, and it's too tiring to keep going.\n\nSo come on, meds.  It's been 3 weeks.  Any time now.",

They are similar to what? Actually the only similarity is that all these bands are from Germany. So the Russians love Germans or what? \"\n\nI replied few weeks later, \" But didn't all these groups make (insert genre name)?\ufeff \"\n\nSame person then said \" Probably they did. And what?

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, \n\nI recently decided to write an article about depression and primarily the reasons why it seems that we have seen such a surge in the number of reported cases, especially at a time in history where some might say we\u2019ve never had it better.\n\nThe reason for me writing this article and getting interested in the illness is a discussion with a family member which took place recently. A member of my family came out as having suffered (and still is) from depression and another family member simply dismissed it saying \u2018Young people nowadays are spoilt\u2019. It wasn\u2019t in English so there\u2019s no direct translation for the word which I have replaced with spilt because it\u2019s quite close.\n\nThis sparked my interest and I have been doing a fair bit of research but I believe there\u2019s nothing like actually speaking to people suffering from depression and getting their views on why we see so many more people with reported cases of depression than we might have seen a couple generations back. \n\nIf anyone is interested in helping me for the article, as I understand it can be quite a personal matter, I would greatly appreciate if you dropped a comment and we could speak over private messages. \n\nThanks",

            "selftext": "I'm a college student finishing up my first year and it hasn't been great. I feel lost, socially excused, mentally checked out; flat out exhausted. I've struggled with depression and mental health issues for most of my life due to traumatic experiences in my past and I was very excited to get to college in hopes of finding some sort of happiness, but instead I've been met with disappointment. I'm doing well in my studies but I feel no sense of accomplishment, I have one friend and I suspect she's only there for me out of pity, I fell into a drug habit (nothing serious like heroin, just weed daily + a little bit of shrooms). I don't know where I'm going or what I'm doing. I have noticed the severe decline in my mental health and stopped using drugs every day, but the sadness still remains. Each day feels like a little battle to find something to be happy about, and I usually can find something to lift my spirits, but it almost always is short-lived. My self-esteem and confidence are virtually non-existent due to me being a little odd - in high school I had a core group of 4 dudes with multiple friends in extracurriculars, but now I am all alone, and I can't help but think the reason I have no friends is because I'm weird or I must be hard to talk to. I have turned into a social recluse and I want nothing more than to break out of this rough patch and jump back into the happiness I once knew. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I would never commit suicide because I would never want to submit those I love to that sort of pain, but I'd be lying if I said the thoughts weren't there. I've thought about seeking help but I lack motivation to do even that. The past two years has been very tough for my family and I: a hurricane damaged our home, I lost my grandfather, and I lost my best friend all due to a misunderstanding. I don't know what to do anymore, everything seems pointless and hopeless.",

I was pissed, lonely, crying myself to sleep without job and almost no friends who understand me. But you guys made me feel like this life is worth living and there are people to love even someone like me. There was one guy around me who kept texting me every 3-4 months to check if I was okay while he was still in the same boat as I am. It just meant sooo much to me guys. I'm finally out of it. Turned my life around, have a nice job. \n\nThe main reason I was depressed is because I found no meaning in life. I just felt everything is random and found no purpose to live for. It weighed me down doing any simple task, however important it was, in my mind it just didn't matter. I was curious to know how others see life, how they find joy in doing stuff. What I realized is most don't think about life this way. When I ask them they all usually say, \"I'm thinking too much\". When I kept hearing this over and over. I stopped and thought maybe not many have figured out yet maybe that's why they say this or maybe that's why it's blissful and maybe I should find the answer myself. Repeating that thought over and over made me realize that Buddha thought the same too. I mean it's said he literally saw the suffering of people for no reason or purpose and went on questioning what could possibly end it and then got enlightened and again reiterating the fact that maybe I found find it myself. This slowly got me out of the hole and better myself, make my life sustainable to find an answer. It might sound silly, maybe life is just random and we are all here just to experience life or raise above the desires and fears.",

I honestly just don't want to speak to anyone anymore, I don't want to bore or annoy them with my life. God, I just feel so fucking sad and embarrassed.\n\nHonestly, she's kind of insensitive and hypocritical. She shamed me for going through puberty out loud (she basically screamed it out) - when it's a natural part of life, and pretty much everyone was currently going through it, and even laughed at me. She also has absolutely no concern for my feelings, and expects me to help her with her low self-esteem when it comes to her intelligence (which I stupidly do) \n\nShe doesn't know how much her words hurt me, and I just want to fucking scream and cry all the time. But I can't. She's part of our friend group, and that would be really unfair on the others - that, and I don't want to be lonely.\n\nShe doesn't even try to feel the littlest bit of empathy for me - I told her about how I'm constantly insulted by my own brothers, and she said \"At least it's better than being alone, words could never hurt me\" She doesn't understand that that's what I thought at first, but my brain kind of got rewired, I guess.\n\nI'm always helping her with whatever she's struggling with - tests, homework, her own personal issues, and I always expect something good from her. All that I feel like I get is jealousy. All that I ever give her is advice - not once have I insulted her, or shamed her for anything. She always has to bring up an embarrassing moment about me, and I just feel so fucking sad and even more socially anxious. I just really wish that I could let out my pain\n\nShe knows how highly sensitive I am. She knows how badly insulted I am. She knows that her, and 3 others are basically my only friends. She knows how fucking sad I am, and how I want to just kill myself, She knows how hard it is for me to speak to people other than her and the other 3 without feeling scared, but she doesn't even feel the littlest bit of concern for me, when that's all that I've given her\n\n\n\nOh, and this one day, she told me \"Well you want to kill yourself anyways\" rather than helping me.",

            "selftext": "Not sure if this even belongs on this subreddit, but here goes:\n\nSo, for about 2-3 years, I've been making art and drawings pretty much every day. It was my favourite thing to do and always cheered me up on a bad day. I could come home from an awful day, on the verge of tears and my mood would completely change once i picked up that pencil. it was wonderful, and When i eventually began posting my art to social media, i gained followers and people who liked it too and encouraged me to carry on, I had more friends than ever before and it was great.\n\nMy family had always been supportive of my art too, they'd be very happy when i went to show them something i'd made, especially my mum and my brother. But recently, I've been noticing that they've been really pushing me. What I mean is, they would encourage me to not just draw whatever i like whenever i like, but they'd talk about how I can get money and fame by doing this. My brother would tell me that I should  start doing commissions, and that i'd get a lot of money from it. My mum, on the other hand, was constantly asking me to draw for other people, and that if i did what she asked me to draw, she would get me anything i wanted. She'd show random people my instagram, and ask me to tell her my name whenever i change it. Now to some people, this is the kind of encouragement they really want, but it's knocking me down. They don't understand that while I love art, it will never be anything more than a hobby to me. I don't want a job in it. I tell them i want to do something to do with geography when i grow up, and they look shocked. They tell me I'm wasting my talent, that i'm wasting an opportunity. \n\nAnd now, it's come to the point where I can't think about art, something that used to be my escape from reality, something that would lift my mood and make me feel carefree, without thinking about it as work, as an exhausting job. I've been going weeks without drawing, months even. It's been so long that I don't even know how to fucking draw anymore. I try to draw with my friends in class and nearly have a breakdown, calling every stroke i draw a fucking monstrosity, and how i want to rip the paper into pieces. I've tried to draw at home and i just break into tears and throw my sketchbook across the room. I haven't touched my watercolour palette nor my instagram in months. In fact, I've deleted it. I'm on the verge of tears even writing this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if anyone else has gone or is going through this, but letting my emotions out is making me feel a bit better. I'm sorry for how long this was.",

My boyfriend just lost 2 very important people to him and I attended both funerals with him. He shed tears but I didn't. I realize that he was closer with these people, but my heart hurt for him, yet I was unable to cry. I have struggled with depression for almost a decade now, as well as GAD. Why cant I cry? I dont want to start crying at the drop of a hat, but I wish I could cry, sometimes just for an emotional release for myself.",

            "selftext": "For years now I have been trying to find someone to love, some friends that I can trust. Today I feel like giving up completely. A couple of years ago my sister gave me a book called \"Models\" by Mark Manson, read it in it's entirety and I began to have some hope for it to work by applying it's principles. I went out and started talking with a group of younger people and spent 2 hours with them. We were talking and joking around, overall I didn't have a bad time. I tried to flirt and show my intentions to one of the girls that I liked, who seemed to like me aswell. In the end they left, the girl told me she will contact me and I've never heard from her again. Stories like this have been plentiful in my life. So much I cant even count. I feel like a miserable pile of shit, someone unlovable and pathetic. When I came back home that day,I tore the book into shreds alongside the shirt I wore that day. Everything I do seems so pointless and meaningless. I feel like 95% of my life could not have happened and I still would be in the same place, with or without my effort and attempts. I have no hope of feeling attractive or finding love. Because of this book now I have even more anxious thoughts and fears. Was I acting needy? Was I not showing my intentions clearly? Who knows...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I stopped going to my therapist, because I felt it cost me too much, while thinking I can deal with this on my own. I guess I was wrong. Human relations and relationships are the main reason for my misery and pain. I feel everyone except my family doesn't care about my wellbeing, how I feel or what I want. I feel completely hopeless and that any action in my life from my part is meaningless and fruitless.",

He need gas so he was returning spray cans he bought. So we went to get gas first. I already knew what was going on. He wanted to use my money for gas, return the cans and get heroine. I spent my money on his gas, he bought drugs off his dealer.\nI got tired assert this point. I thought of my friends and family and how much of a burden I am. How much of a prick I am. \nI thought about suicide then. About how nice it would be to cut myself. I never wanted to cut myself that badly. I thought of it and was excited about it. If I was able to be alone yesterday night, I would of did it. But my dad sleeps in the same room as me.\nI tried to sleep, I wanted to cry but couldn't. I would have to explain why I was crying. So I thought of my friends and family. How they have to hate me. How my grandma yelled at me for not being grateful for what I have, saying I'm a disappointment. My friend/acquaintances. How my friend V has to think of me as a burden. Same with the other two. They only talk to me because they have too.\nI'm just a failure, I don't want to get out of bed ever. I only do if I'm told or to go to school. I don't clean my room or myself anymore. I don't care about eating, I only do if its home cooked. I drink maybe half a bottle of water and a soda a day.\nI want to talk to someone but don't want to be even more of a burden. I don't deserve it. I don't deserve what I have, the food I throw away, the house I can live in, the education I get. I don't even feel like I deserve to be happy anymore.\nI really want to cut myself when I get home. I want to talk. I want to just disappear. \nIm a failure. I don't deserve the things I have. I feel horrible. I can't talk to my friends for their sake and my family doesn't think depression is bad, but just an excuse. So whats the point of telling anyone. \nI feel so numb. When I'm not, I want to die. I'm just done with hating myself. I don't want to be a burden. I'm getting closer to wanting to do something more dramatic. I might cut myself tonight. Why not.\nSorry for the long post.

            "selftext": "Hey there. I'm new to this subreddit and it would mean a lot to me if my post wouldn't die in new, because im putting all of my emotions (and time) into it, even though I should probably be learning for final exams. Sorry if some grammar-stuff or anything like that sounds weird, but English isn't my native language.\n\nFirst of - I'd just like to tell you that I really enjoy browsing this subreddit because I can see that I'm not the only one having trouble with certain things and that there are other humans trying their best to share some love to other, **random** people on the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**&lt;3**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if you have some good recommendations, I've been listening to a lot of emo-rap lately (like *Roses* from *Juice WRLD* or *Loyalty* from *Clever*) because I can actually kinda relate to those songs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI basically have no one to talk to about this, except you guys. I feel like, if I tell my parents I would most likely insult their parenting in some way. In school (and that's a fact, not just my way of thinking) everyone would probably make fun of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome nights I'm laying in my bed, staying awake until 4 am, thinking about what a mess I am. On other nights I'm sitting in the window frame^(?) of my room, enjoying the view, listening to music, sometimes while crying. I could probably talk endlessly about why I'm feeling down, but I think I'll just stick with the main reasons here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 10, maybe 11, I had exactly 7 friends. Since I was the one who always had to text (really cheap first smartphone with no apps or games) or call the person I wanted to meet up with I got quite annoyed by it. I just stopped contacting them to see who at least was interested enough in our friendship to contact *me*. This lead to me losing 5 friends.\n\nEven my *best* friend, whom I'd known since I was born, was amongst them. At first, I tried to keep up the conctact with him (while this little \"experiment\" of mine was taking place), because I really didn't want to lose him as well. But then he did something, that really **yelled \"I dont want to be around you\".** I sadly don't exactly remember what he did, because a lot of time has passed since then, but I felt absolutely betrayed. I spent a lot of time thinking about what I did, that made them ***hate*** me. I **hated** *myself* for beeing so stupid, that I didn't even know what exactly I did for them to despise me. Even though as of now I think I didn't do anything silly for them to turn their backs against me.\n\nThis happening, while puberty kicking in, you guessed it, didn't quite end well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year later my grandfather got cancer. I kind of wished I'd have been  around him more towards his death, because we really had a stronger bond than most grandfathers and grandchildren have, but it was just too painful too see him this helpless. He almost comepletely stopped talking a few days before his death because it would hurt him. Meaning, he only said something when it was important. I remember visiting him a week before he passed. After I got up from his bed and told him goodbye he said, in this really weak voice, just \"goodbye\". We both knew, that it would probably be the last time we get to talk and see each other, which was the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2015 my father got cancer. Due to surgerys, he luckily was able to survive. Though, because of the surgerys, he mostly wasn't able to work for 2 years, which is why my parents and I (to this day) have financial problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n^(At this point I've had depressions at least for over 4 years. -&gt;) About 3 months ago, it started too look like it was going uphill for me once. Even just thinking about getting happier made me cheer up a little. I had (and actually still have) a huge crush on a girl from my class, because she basically was the first person in my life to tell me I'm cute, or give me compliments at all. We also listen to the same music, do the same stuff in our free time, etc. The only problem was, that she had a boyfriend. So I figured it's just her way to express herself and doesn't really mean she's interested in me. But then she broke up with him and I was kind of hoping for a chance. After seeing and spending time with her in class almost everyday for about another 2 weeks, we were invited to the same party (pls dont think of me as an extrovert lol). We were sitting inside the living room, just talking about stuff, when she suddenly outed herself, saying she was probably lesbian. This hit me genuinely hard because she was, and is, the only girl I **really** showed interest in so far. Especially, because I was just a few days away from asking her out for a date. I instantly knew she wasnt lying, because she was still quite sober, and usually people (especially if she would've been drunk) dont just make stuff like that up, out of nowhere.\n\nMy self-esteem has yet again hit rock bottom. I was finally having the hope to get out of my depressions, to get happy, to not be lonely. But that hope was crushed in an instant. Out of nowhere. It hit me like a truck, and It's like I'm still in a coma. I guess I'm just not meant to be happy.",

We used to play games together and have kinda stopped playing and I think thats where we drifted too much.\n\nHe has made multiple posts to this subreddit and he has never told me, I only found out today when looking through his account for an old post. he has talked about self-harm and I feel sick hearing that. I feel this way because I would never want to see him in that way and also because I have never noticed and have never questioned anything.\n\nIn his post, he said that he wanted to go to a specialist but is too scared to talk to his parents about it. I don't know whether to tell his parents or let him as I think he needs to see someone about this.\n\nI also don't know how to talk to him about this as he hasn't told me and maybe he doesn't want my help. he may also just not know how to reach out so maybe I should \"reach in\".  I know it sounds corny but ill be honest I don't know what or how to say anything to him.\n\nThx for any help,\n\nLuke",

What am I grateful for? \n\nAnd a bonus question at the end of the day... think of something not so great that happened, and ask yourself \"Why did this happen for me?\" Life happens for us, not to us, my mentor has said. Change our thoughts, and we change our feelings. \n\nI wish you all a positive day. \nXoxo Jess",

I completely understand that you\u2019re not therapists but for nearly 2 years I\u2019ve been dealing with intense anxiety and suicidal thoughts and it\u2019s been getting so rampant that I lose sleep, I lose my appetite and even think about my family and loved ones beating the crap out of me and belittle the pathetic snot ball I so call my existence. I have nasty skeletons in my closet and I still don\u2019t think I should just blurt it out towards everyone I come across. I have done things that I wish i could take back and fix the damage I caused. I wish that I didn\u2019t have to suffer, I have been haunted every single day of my past mistakes that I honestly want to die just to end my restless agony. And if the situations were different, I would have croaked a long time ago and rightfully so..... sometimes I even wonder why the hell am I still alive. everyday I wonder what makes my life so important, what makes me so special, how can anyone trust me if I let my skeletons loose. I have been having mental breakdowns 3 times in a row yesterday and I\u2019m having one now as a type this. I hate sounding like an edgy teenager but this is something I just cannot do alone... Thank you everyone who went through the trouble of reading my long ass story it honestly makes my life a little more livable. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9a",

It's had it's ups and downs, and I've been medicated for it for the past 4 years. There have been only a few times where I've had suicidal thoughts, but for the past month, it's been nearly every day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've waited it out to see if it would pass, like it usually does, but it hasn't. It's gotten to the point where I cry all the time because I'm afraid of thinking about it. After a really bad evening where none of my friends would respond to my texts, I finally broke down and told my mom. She knows I'm medicated for anxiety and depression, but I usually have a pretty sunny demeanor as to not scare her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was extremely happy that I told her about what was going on in my brain, and she was glad that I came to her when I did. She is adamant that I go for a doctor's appointment to talk about medication changes or possibly therapy. I'm having a lot of trouble making the appointment. I'm scared  to talk to a therapist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if anyone could share their experiences with therapy (good or bad) so maybe I can get a feel of what I'll be getting in to.",

People knew me because of my smile and how often I flaunted it. But recently so many things have been falling around me and I feel myself breaking down.\n\nLast night in bed, so many thoughts were crashing around in my head. Thoughts about school, my love life, family, my health, just everything. I put my heads under the covers and curled into a ball trying to comfort myself, but nothing worked. And then it happened. I started crying. Not uncontrollable wailing or anything, but tears were flowing freely down my face. I've never felt more vulnerable and weak. I've always tried to be strong for myself and always thought I could overcome whatever life throws at me. But I know that I can't anymore. I've been worn down to the bones and I feel like a walking skeleton whenever I get out of bed; no brain, no heart, no personality. I know some people say that crying should actually *help* you, but it didn't. At least not this time. I really don't know how to feel about breaking down. I'm currently at work trying not to breakdown again.\n\nI am currently at the lowest point in my life and I really don't know what to do anymore.

Anyone tried punishment treatment where you whip yourself as a punishment? Is there something I have never heard of?",

However something has been wrong and it\u2019s been going on for 3 years.\n\nI feel a lack of interest and connection with anybody. My social skills have degenerated immensely. I haven\u2019t had a gf or even made a friend for 3 years. This has caused my quality of life to suffer soo much and I know it must be related to some sort of social anxiety but even if I\u2019m not really anxious I have trouble feeling ANYTHING when talking with people. Everyone reaction, every comment, every facial expression must be acted. I don\u2019t get excited about things intensely or crack up laughing and haven\u2019t forever. Most people look at me and think maybe I\u2019m just one of those introverted hard shell ppl who\u2019s okay being like that but I\u2019m not. I long for good social interactions and connections but my brain feels DULL. My brain just seems to shut off.\n\nMy family has noticed this about me but doesn\u2019t seem worried because it\u2019s not the crying closed away in my room for days type of depression symptoms. But it is very real for me. It gets to the point where I can go days not talking to anyone (which is crazy cuz I\u2019m in college) because I know if I do the interactions never go well and again my brain is DULL and I don\u2019t get that good smile jerking feeling most ppl do when socializing. \n\nIf my quality of life has suffered so much and so many opportunities missed because of this dull stoic cloud that is always over me, should I look to getting medication? I feel like if I told a doctor about this they\u2019d see that I\u2019m healthy and seem confident and stable and not think i need it but they don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s affecting me. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m missing some brain hormone like oxytocin or serotonin or something that makes ppl feel good when socializing because I literally feel nothingggg. I wasn\u2019t always like this either I used to be the talkative one in class and always with a group of friends.",

I drank cleaning supplies, was getting drunk all the time and eventually checked myself into the hospital. For the first time in a really long time, I don't want to kill myself. I no longer see that as an option even though I don't want to be alive. In the hospital I was given a shot of abilify-and lately I've been socially anxious to the max. It's been difficult going to any situation where people are around, my heart begins to pound, I get nauseous. This is weird for me because I normally don't give a fuck what people think and it's been long enough that the shot wore off.   \n\n\nI don't know what's going on with me or my body and it's frustrating as I've just recently taken the resolve to not die by suicide and it feels like my body &amp; brain seems to be fighting back telling me that's wrong. I've always had anxiety but not to feeling like throwing up whenever people are around level. I've talked to people about it, hotlines about it, I don't know who to go to and my only form of/access to medication is a walk-in clinic. I've got work in an hour and for the next couple days and I'm dreading this whole weekend - dreading being home - dreading everything and everywhere and I can't find places I feel safe anymore. Any tips, advice, something?",

And I\u2019m nervous to ask for help from a behavioral psychologist because I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m being melodramatic. \n\nDepression, insomnia, and anxiety run in my family. I know as far back as my grandmother having depression, and my dad having depression, insomnia, and anxiety. I\u2019ve had insomnia since the second grade and I used to get bad anxiety in high school, but I never went to see a psychologist and haven\u2019t really had anxiety since. \n\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m looking for validation from others to seek help or if I\u2019m being dramatic/not understanding of those who truly are depressed. \n\nAny help is appreciated.",

            "selftext": "My parents are going to divorce and I also have exams coming up and I'm very stressed. I've already told my parents how their fights really make me anxious and worried and said that they'll 'not talk about the divorce when I'm around and until I'm done with my exams', so that I have more space for myself and my exams.\n\nI also told them about my self-harm, but they don't really take it serious because I'm only using my keys to scrape myself and see it as 'a phase that will go away eventually' (I'm 16). \n\nFor a while it's been quiet, I told some close friends about my situation and they said that they're here for me, support me etc. \n\nBut lately, my parents are literally joking about their divorce and that they're glad they won't have to spend the rest of their lives with one another. This strikes me so hard because I love them both very much. Besides that, some of my friends are also calling me 'emo' as a joke and make fun of my 'past' self-harm habits.\n\nI know these are just jokes, but for me they just aren't funny. I don't want to talk to my parents about how it makes me feel because I don't feel like they understand me, and the same goes for my friends. I've been hurting myself a lot more lately to the point for I make actual cuts with a knife and I already thought about how I should end myself.\n\nI don't know what to do about it, I don't feel any motivation to learn for my exams or even continue my life. I was wondering if any of you have any advice on how to deal with this situation. I've tried to continue working out and play instruments (I've been playing for 4 years now) but I've also decided to quit these lately because I feel like it doesn't matter, I'm not good at it and I don't even enjoy it anymore. What I usually do everyday is force myself to learn (which isn't very effective) and isolate myself in my room. I know I can improve easily if I step out of my comfort zone but I just don't have the motivation. What do I do?",

She'll be at my apartment from the 30th of April until the 3rd of May. Honestly every day is unbearable for me. I don't even know how to survive until the 30th. It's just awful.\n\nI got through Easter and the last weeks by just doing as much stuff as possible and meeting people to distract myself. Only when I'm around others and preoccupied do I forget that I want to cry constantly. I actually had a blast at times. Just laughing and drinking and dancing myself away. But I can't do that everyday. After partying I still come home and realize my life is broken beyond fixing.\n\nHow the hell am I supposed to get through all of those days? I hope I won't be too much of a pain when my friend is visiting. \n\nI need tips to survive this. It's also that I'm so struck by depression rights now that I just want to close the blinds shut and lay in the dark all day. I wouldn't even eat necessarily. Don't know what to do. I mean that just makes it harder. I can't really commit to anything either because I know that I might die soon and then disappoint people. So I'm just in this limbo of meaninglessness.\n\nPlease help,",

            "selftext": "Hello. Im suffering from depression since i was 15. At least i think so. Im almost 24 now. Today i got a preliminary talk (im not sure thats the right word for it... its the talk u get to get pre-diagnosed and assigned a therapist). I was very much afraid of it. But it turned out wonderful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe therapist was kind and i felt validated in my feelings. I always thought i had no right to be depressed because my life went pretty well on the surface. I got good grades in school and im almost finishing my bachelors degree at university. My parents have their problems but are loving and i also love them very much. But when i laid out my whole life story and the feelings that go with it i was at the edge of crying the whole time. I could see on the face of the therapist and how she talked that she acknowledged i was hurting and that its \u00a8normal\u00a8. It was really great \u00a8me time\u00a8 and i look forward to my therapy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe let me talk and asked a lot of pretty punctual questions about how i feel exactly. She was obviously going down a symptom list but that didnt bug me because it was still very personal on some level. I can read symptom lists myself and knew i would get diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. Thats exactly what i got. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cant really explain why it felt so good. It felt like time someone spent was about me for once and i didnt need to be afraid to be honest except for a few exceptions. I hid that i drink too much alcohol and smoke weed because they wouldnt take me as a patient otherwise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really dont know where im going with this post. I just want to share my positive impression with anyone struggling to get help. I feel very relieved because now im not just waiting for nothing but waiting to get help and get better. My future seems less dark now. I hope i can find an end of the tunnel. Thanks if you read this and i hope the same for you! \n\nIf someones up to talk id very much like it. Iv got nothing to do for the next 3 hours and would like some company so please let me know!",

Once I make enough money I fall back to the same doing nothing. \n\nI've tried everything to motivate myself. Read (listened while walking my dog) every self-improvement book and watched every inspiring video on youtube. I tried writing goals every morning and making them specific. I tried every existing form of time management. Nothing works. \n\nA few months ago I started having suicidal thoughts. This is really scary but I really don't want to live like that where I don't have any control. \n\nIs there anyone who has dealt with this? Anyone tried punishment treatment where you whip yourself as a punishment? Is there something I have never heard of?",

It has had some backlashes like sudden outbursts of anger and depression leaked over the mask mostly while drunk, crying and sometimes self harming tendencies.\n\nI had the mask so long that i even forgot i had it. From time to time i realized i was depressed but then i kinda subconsciously found the mask again and forgot that i was depressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also had my introvert mask  for 26 years or so. I learned about it and took it off and thought i was a whole new person! Like weight off the world lifted off my shoulders.\n\nAfter that i was somewhat \"happy\", illusion which depressed person might have sometimes, feel like its over but soon enough its back.\n\nMy life is not that bad to be honest, i have had a wife for many years and shes probably the reason i still have purpose in life, i have friends and family who cares.\n\nBut depression does not care if the person is happy and positive, it can hit on anyone without a warning and without a reason, but for me i was basically born with it.\n\nAfter realizing i have been depressed so long i thought realizing it would help, but now that i know i feel even worse.\n\nIs there even a cure if you have born with depression? or is it just hardwired in you're brain to be miserable\\`and just need to try to act positive?",

I always feel sluggish and horrible, I only eat about twice a day and even then it\u2019s either snacks or a microwave meal because I just can\u2019t find the energy to cook something decent for myself. Ive stopped going to the gym cause I feel like it\u2019s pointless, I\u2019m unconfident about my appearance and it gets worse by the day. I\u2019ve struggled making friends at university, I feel so lonely and it feels like I don\u2019t even matter anymore, and I see all my friends from school on social media having fun at university and it just makes me feel like I\u2019m a waste of space. My family doesn\u2019t even live in the country so I don\u2019t see them for 3 months at a time. Im always stressed out, every day I wake up and I want to go back to sleep, I can\u2019t remember the last time I woke up on the right side of the bed. I want to get better but at this rate I doubt I\u2019m going to make it to 21st birthday. The only thing stopping me from killing my self is I know how much it would hurt my family, but at the same time when I tell them about my depression they act as if it\u2019s an excuse for me to just be lazy.",

So a little context, we are dating for around 5 months already. By this time, i already know most about her. Especially her depression. She was raped thrice growing up and was molested. She told me her life has been really bad all throughout. I'm a college student studying nursing so i have an idea on how to help her but it's not enough. I thought i was doing good and am actually helping her. But then lately she's been really down. I can sense it from her but she's been been avoiding it by bringing up a different topic every single time. I keep reassuring here that i'm always here for her and would do anything to her her. But i can feel she's been avoiding me and has been keeping secrets about her from myself.  I asked hee about it by asking how she is and what she feels. She would just shrug it off and says \"I'm okay\" buy i know she isnt. She's been telling me stuff like she wants to jump off a building etc. and it's killing me so much that i dont know what to do. \n\nPlease. I love her too much to see her in so much pain. I don't know what to do anymore. Please i desperately need help. What should i do to help? Please.",

Went back to my old job and now I can\u2019t stop regretting it and haven\u2019t heard back from my reference. Really down on myself for my decisions.  \n\nIn December an old professor recommended me for a position at well known company within my field and I interviewed and got the job. It paid quite a bit more than my last job and had good benefits. \n\nI hated it from the start. I hated pretty much everything about it except for how it looked on my resume. I didn\u2019t like the work, I hated the commute (which worked out to be 3-4 hours per day total). The people were nice though, for the most part. \n\nMy fear of my professor not giving me a recommendation anymore kept me there for the first couple months. I tried to commit to being there for certain amount of time and not focus on how much I hated it, and I made it the 2.5 months but wasn\u2019t very successful at not fixating on how terrible it was. \n\nI decided to quit and go back to my old job temporarily until I found a new one. Once I quit of course things got much more bearable. I started enjoying the people more, feeling better about the commute, etc. When it was my last day they were super nice and it made me kind of sad, but still kind of relieved. \n\nI started back at my old job (which I\u2019m overqualified for and don\u2019t make as much money at), and I feel like an idiot. I keep beating myself up and calling myself a quitter and basically just wondering what I have done. \n\nI messaged my professor that I left the job on good terms for another position (vague), but the plan is for me to still work per diem as needed (true). I expressed gratitude for recommending me for the job and said that I hoped I could still use him as a reference. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t responded and I feel like shit. I feel like I lost my one good reference because I am a quitter. I need his reference if I want to go to grad school or even get another job in the field because I worked for him for 2 years as well as took his class. \n\nI feel so horrible about what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m filled with the regret and shame and I can\u2019t stop beating myself up. I can\u2019t even enjoy this low stress/extra time off to decompress because I can\u2019t stop beating myself up over this decision and now my reference\u2019s lack of response. I feel like I\u2019ve destroyed my future.",

            "selftext": "I've been living abroad for going on 8  years and I have embraced the high highs and low lows that accompany  this way of life, but recently some aspects of it have felt truly  insurmountable. I'm sorry in  advance if this is long.\n\nIn a nutshell,  in the past 3 years I  have been rotating between living in both Madrid and in Paris. Last year  I left a demanding, but on paper great job here in Madrid for one in  Paris that seemed like a dream opportunity and great accomplishment,  well paid and with lots of travel. \n\nImmediately upon relocating  back to Paris I entered a loving relationship with a local and  everything appeared to be going my way for a time. I felt as if all of  my past struggles and insecurities were all building towards something  and that I was manifesting my potential etc. etc.\n\nAt the end of  this \"great opportunity\" trial period, I was sacked abruptly and without  warning, for lacking leadership skills and vision. They'd hoped an  outside hire would revolutionize their way of doing things rather than  struggle to keep up with their old way of doing things. I was  devastated.\n\nMy partner was very emotionally supportive at this  incredibly low time, she loved me how I needed to be loved and I felt  safe with her at a time where I felt as if my life was ruined. After a  really brutal one month of not working (which I used to finally finish  my Master's degree, which kept getting delayed because of working  full-time) I got really lucky and found another job in Paris, but  unfortunately right away I wasn't happy in it as it was a step down and  my depression furthered. I was really lucky to have my partner's  emotional support because I kept feeling haunted, as if I ruined my  life, that I am a failure, and that I don't belong in my field (or  anywhere)\n\nI tried my best to stay strong but I could feel myself  losing the optimism i had about the future. The relationship was the  only thing redeeming in my life as she was super loving and kind and  present and communicative and accepted me. I had spent all my years of  being single looking for someone with exactly these traits so I tried to  tell myself the purpose of these setbacks was to bring me to her. We  both suffer from depression and anxiety, but could help each other cope.  She would sleep over more nights than not and would hold me if I woke  up panicked or crying. I have been seeing a therapist for 3 years but I  decided to start treatment with medication because the pervasive feeling  that my future (and all of the qualities of my personality that I like,  like my sense of humor) have all been stolen from me was something I've  never experienced before. \n\nBecause I wasn't thrilled with the  second job in Paris, and I was blaming Paris for my stress and anxiety, I  decided to move back to Madrid where I have always been more at peace  and my partner accompanied me with the intention of living here with me  because she also was not happy in Paris and wanted to try something new  after hearing all my stories about Madrid. I was able to find another  communications job and a flat here immediately. Because I was at work  all day, my partner was at home alone and got homesick and struggled to  adjust. Her parents were always very strict, and she wanted to be away  from them, and the idea of joining me here in Madrid was an adventure to  her but ultimately after a month her homesickness / anxiety overwhelmed  her and she abruptly moved back to Paris and we broke up.\n\nThe  rock bottom state is not just because of the breakup, but also the  career frustration, aging, and losing my optimism about the future and  the feeling that I am a person with potential, as well as frustration  about needing to move flats once again because I cannot justify the cost  of staying in this 1-BR alone much longer. (This will be my 14th flat  in 8 years)\n\nI have been struggling to focus, forgetting to eat,  and keep feeling like I am a continued disappointment to my parents, my  grad school cohort, and every mentor figure or friend that cheered for  my success this past year. I miss waking up next to my partner and being  held by her, and comforted. I get emotional support from friends, two  in particular have really stepped up, and I know people care about me,  and that nobody is being as hard on me as I am on myself, but I just  feel so defeated. I can't untangle this and don't even know where to  start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: A tired expat lost a dream job, dream girl, and has completely lost his optimism about the future and cannot function.",

            "selftext": "Hey y'all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I recently started an MBA program, while working full time. Noticing I'd have little time for a social life, I pulled back and dropped out of most social obligations. This includes breaking up with my GF, and cancelling almost all standing weekday plans. However, now that I'm not staying busy, depression and intense anxiety attacks have started to creep into my life! In terms of depression, I've been having feelings of hopelessness/hollowness, pessimistic views of the future and errant thoughts of suicide. In terms of anxiety, I spent the week staying up crying, because I'm paranoid I have bed bugs and tore apart my room (I don't have them... And had no signs besides a couple mosquito bites... But I now have anxiety at 4am and it is horrible!). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd say the main cause of my depression is because I just turned 30, and my fiance cheated on me 6 months ago as we were closing on a house. And after that happened, I knew I could be facing depression, so pushed myself to constantly stay busy and outrun the depression! It worked for the last 6 months! But now that I am slowing down, the depression, self-doubt, self-loathing and desire to just stop and give up has come back. In addition, I am realizing I am the least  bisexual if not just gay or potentially trans, so that adds a bit more onto the pile...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here's the thing, I don't have the time to let this depression affect me! I'm not just gunna sit back, let it wash over me and actually give up. And if anyone here were to meet me, you'd never think I had these problems (I'm one of those 'but he always seemed so happy, we never saw the signs' type of people). But I also don't have the time or energy any more to stay busy and keep pushing myself to do all the social things that helped stave off my depression. Does anyone have any advice on how I can handle this return of depression and anxiety. Or helpful tips on how to manage this anxiety?",

I have people around me who make me smile and what not! They support me, but I\u2019m sad. All the time. No matter what I do or what I try, I feel sad. I\u2019m trapped in a never ending cycle of fucking shit up. I\u2019ve tried all sorts of therapies to help change my mind set, but my emotional state is too high all of the time.

            "selftext": "People of reddit, I'm brand new in this r/ and would like some help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI find myslef broken as I'm a 22yo man and trying to make it in life. (apologize in advance for the grammar as this ain't my first language)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been working abroad for 9 months tomorrow and I've been pretty good at it. Started from the bottom and after 4 months I got a promotion. I feel like I already learnt everything that this job has to offer and I was looking around to find a better place. I got contacted by a company where they offered me 3k a month and I am really tempted as it would be more than trice what I actually get. All good until now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fact is that last week (16/04) I received a call from my brother informing me that my mother had to go to the hospital and she almost didn't make it (she basically collapsed and her body got rigid, with her tongue stuck in her throat, luckily it all happened on a Sunday and my older brother and father were home). She has been taking exams but no one knows what is it and why it happened. Point is that it could happen anytime now and most of the time she's alone or only with my little bro which probably wouldn't know what to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm stuck between going back home because I'm worried sick for my mom, even tho it could also be nothing or taking this job that could really elevating me into life success. I'm living this period with a deep depression. I just don't care about nothing anymore. I'm a super positive person and everyday I come to work I use to yell \"Goodmorning\" to everyone going after one by one to ask how they're doing ecc. I'm now always stoic and it seems that there's nothing that helps me get out of bed anymore. I'm starting to get bad habits. I'm drinking everyday after work, doing some stupid expenses, eating like shit and having an unhealthy routine overall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other option is to get home to my mother in a city with no prospect of growing as a person and as an employee, probably sealing my fate as just another average Joe who couldn't make it. But my mother holds a very special place in my heart. I never told her this kind of things but now that me and my family live in different part of the world I really feel how much they mean to me and how much of an idiot I am for having so much pride to not being able to tell them. \n\nI'm just torn and weeping right now, hiding the tears because I'm in the office. I don't want to loose them.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for all this mumbling, it probably came out shitty and it's unreadable. \u00ab I just had of taking it out of my chest as here I don't trust anyone with this kind of info.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think about this, and please, give me some sort of hope, I need it ..",

I wouldn't want them to die, or go through anything horrible or painful, but their little issues that I could usually help with just annoy me now.\n\nLike, my friend's unsure if they want to go see a film with us, and say they know they'll feel bad if they don't. So just go? If you'd feel bad afterwards then just go, why are you bothering me about this? \n\nThere's lots of other things as well about friends and family. Like my mum always being ill. I k ow it's not her fault, and there's nothing she can do about it, but I just get so sick of her complaining all the time. I already know that she's always in pain. I don't need to be reminded for a 500th time. \n\nI don't know. I feel bad about it, especially as I used to be so empathic. Now I just wish people would keep things more to themselves and try their hardest to deal with it first. And I know friends are people you're meant to be able to vent to, but I feel like I've been used as someone to vent to my whole life, and I'm just so sick of it now. I vent to people as well, but no where near as much and about as many little things as other do.\n\nTbh, I'm probably being dramatic. Just get irritated by everything now.\n\nAnd of course I know that something that might seem trivial to me may be very serious to someone else, but god I just can't push myself to care.",

I haven\u2019t stopped since and I still am crying this morning.\n\nIt seems like everyday is getting worse for me. I keep losing the hope I am trying have to keep going. I feel completely alone. \n\nI don\u2019t get the support I need from my boyfriend. His words last night at some points were \u201cstop overreacting\u201d.  I fear I\u2019m losing him due to my emotions.\n\nI tried hitting up some friends. Most left me on read.\n\nMy parents were always the ones yelling at me when I was younger. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with depression since 8th grade, and yet, I still feel like no one actually takes me seriously or cares to actually try and see me happy.\n\nI haven\u2019t stopped therapy since I started all those years ago.  I take daily medication. I\u2019ve been to both out and in-patient programs. For some reason, my head thinks I should be a lot better by now...\n\nI feel so lost and alone. Is there any suggestions you guys might have as far as:\n1. Next steps or where to go/do from here\n2. How to cheer myself up or find ways to make myself happy without needing someone else. \n3. Anything that might help really...?\n\nThank You in Advance,\nI hope you all have a great day!",

I\u2019m simply here to help you get that get that slimy:ugly thing called depression away from you. \r\n\t\r\nIt does get very tough.You may feel as if you want to roll yourself up and just leave somewhere far away. You might also feel like \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of living\u201d i know this because i\u2019ve been in your shoes.I'm here to tell you that you can get rid of depression with just a couple steps. \r\n\t\r\n\tWhen I was dealing with depression I quickly found out that i had to be real with myself and realize that I was depressed. After coming to that realization and taking that first step, at that very moment I understood that i didn\u2019t have to be a prisoner any longer.\r\n\r\n\tGoing through depression can be a very vulnerable/confusing time, well at-least i know it was for me. \r\nLook... \r\nI know it\u2019s hard talking to people about this; you probably feel like they\u2019ll look at you in pity, but i promise that won\u2019t be the case if you get someone you can trust. It doesn't have to be a counselor: your parents, or anyone you don't want it to be. Go talk to someone who makes you feel comfortable, makes you feel like nothing else matters but you and helping you.\r\n\r\nThe last step I have for you that i believe helped me the most is\u2026\r\n\r\nPrayer...\r\n\r\nThroughout the time i was dealing with depression; I often times contemplated suicide. One night out of nowhere it hit me and I fell on my knees and began to pray, well i did more crying than actual talking but you catch my drift. There will be tough times where you feel so lost, but i'm telling you and truly believe that spiritual reassurance is  necessary when dealing with depression.\r\n\r\nNow as much as I would like every last step to help you not all of them might. If you happen to find one of these steps useful I wholeheartedly encourage you to take it and run with it. It won't always be easy, but just because it's hard doesn't make it impossible.\r\nKeep Pushing, Keep Going\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd remember, you are not Alone...",

Being fit made me so much happier. \n\nHere I am 2 years later, 2 torn ACLs later, 2 surgeries but nothing fixed later.  Then I found out I had an unhealed fracture in my back and tailbone.  Not to mention my ankle is still fucked.  Eczema and staph infections all over my legs. A pit in my stomach about how since I set that goal I\u2019ve made my body 10x worse.  My goal was to become a physical therapist but after spending over a year and a half in PT I\u2019d rather die.  I\u2019m supposed to have another surgery, another 8 months of PT. Idk if I can do that.  I\u2019d rather just eat in my bed and occasionally go on a walk. \n\nI don\u2019t want to deal with this. I feel like an old man. Depression just makes my symptoms worse.",

            "selftext": "I didn\u2019t realize I have depression until maybe six months ago when I first had the idea to jump into a train rail. That incident was a wake up call to me that maybe I\u2019m not just sad. I started to go to psychotherapy and it costed a lot of money. At first it seems to make me feel better but after two months the therapist told me that she thinks she may not be able to help me and refer me to a psychiatrist. I then started to take anti depressants and anti anxiety pills regularly. At first it seems to lift up my mood quite a lot. At least I would be able to eat, get up at work and wouldn\u2019t cry non-stop. Three months now, I realized the medicine won\u2019t help me anymore bc I\u2019m not able to sleep, eat and get up to work again. All just bc of my ex. When my ex was nice to me (we\u2019ve been keeping in touch and kind of turning to a special friend relationship) I was okay. But when I felt heartbroken bc of something about us, it all came back. All these emotions, tears, insomnia.\n\nThe psychiatrist and the medicine costed a lot in where I live, tried to sort out cheaper alternatives but no luck. I realized it\u2019s not about the psychiatrist or psychotherapy, it\u2019s about me.  If I can\u2019t get over this break up, nothing can help me feel better. And the fact is, I couldn\u2019t. I tried many times but I couldn\u2019t. I know people all say time will help and you\u2019ll be okay one day/soon, but the thing is, I really tried very hard but I failed, again and again. \n\nHe shown me a world that I couldn\u2019t  unseen\nHe made me a better person that I couldn\u2019t go back and I don\u2019t want to bc I like the girl I am that he transformed me\n\nIdk why this break up was so bad, I had other breakups but I never felt this way. The professional analysis from both the psychiatrist and psychotherapist said it\u2019s bc he is the first man I ever love (I\u2019m 37) they said I never really know what love is and how to love someone before him regardless of the relationships I had in the past and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard now.   \n\nI can\u2019t afford any psychiatrist or psychotherapy anymore. I\u2019m going to just stop seeing any of these...I\u2019m so fucked up.",

            "selftext": "So, I'm in my third year of Dental School. I've been suffering from depression since 14. Have had bouts of severe depression now and then, had an episode of debilitating depression last year, it lasted for 6 months.  On top of this mess, a tragedy befell upon me 2 months ago, a loved one passed away. I live alone and so asked my mother to come home to make sure I'm okay today. I have severe blues in the morning. The only thing that keeps me motivated is my passion for books. Recently visited a psychiatrist since the last time I took meds, I ended up feeling like a zombie. They gave me the wrong dosage as well. I started taking meds a week ago. Seriously low on energy today, but I have to push myself to go to University tomorrow. I hope I feel alive after a long time once sunshine falls upon me tomorrow. Stay strong people.",

I haven't jumped yet because I cant, it has gotten so bad, I want it to end. but it won't end.  \nI can't jump because I feel like I don't deserve to jump, I feel like I deserve this pain, I always have, I have got it so good and yet I'm unhappy, what a piece of shit right?   \nI'm a horrible person, I deserve to die but not like this, I don't deserve to die right now when it hurts.   \nI want to keep hurting because I know that when I don't anymore ill be able to jump.  \nand I don't know what to do.  \nI know she comes to this subreddit often and maybe she will read this without knowing it's me, but if she does read this I'm sure she will understand why I left, I don't matter, she doesn't care, she shouldn't care if she does, why me, I'm scum why me. please forget me, everyone forgets me.  \nlet me go because I cant. all my life living with myself and I'm tired  \nI feel exhausted when I get up every day  \nI take the pills undeservingly and I feel wrong  \neveryone will forget me, my friends, my family, I'm not important  \nis not destined to make anything important, I'm sure of it. and ill be gone.  \nnot today, but when I am, I want to leave before they feel like a stranger.  \nI'm sorry. I'm sorry I can't jump.",

You go to the emergency room, and they give you a local shot to numb your arm so they can set it and put it in a cast. They finish putting the cast on, and you\u2019re sitting waiting for them to bring you your discharge papers. Your condition hasn\u2019t changed, your arm is still broken, and in a cast, and you still can\u2019t move your arm, but your arm is not in pain. You can\u2019t move your arm, but you\u2019re not hopelessly despondent or overly worried about it. You are able to go on with your life, but you still can\u2019t move your arm. It makes life more difficult, and you learn to manage and maneuver in your new reality, but the fact that you still can\u2019t move your arm remains. You can\u2019t move your arm, but you\u2019re not depressed or anxious about it.* \n\nThat\u2019s how I feel no matter what medication I try. That it works really well to get rid of the depression and anxiety, but my condition hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019m just not depressed and anxious about it. (Like I said, VERY hard to describe, hence the analogy.) \nI have an illness, and it\u2019s treating the SYMPTOMS of the illness, but I\u2019m still ill. Every fibre of my being tells me every morning to just stay in bed, STILL, even though I\u2019m not feeling depressed or anxious. I\u2019m NOT numb, (I DON\u2019T WANT THAT PART OF THE ANALOGY TO STAND OUT.) I can feel joy and love and good things. But I\u2019m exhausted. Always. Hygiene and good housekeeping are on an absolutely as needed basis. But I\u2019m not depressed or anxious. \n\nMy lack of complete remission from medications available now makes me very interested in the new research going on regarding the inflammation associated with depression, how it affects your whole body, convincing your body and brain that you are sick, hence the wanting to stay in bed. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?",

However, something I've noticed recently is that since the playing field is basically 100 guys to a girl, girls seem to have more success in dating/relationships/one nighters etc... E.g. a friend of mine literally gets 99+ tinder matches within seconds of downloading it vs me, decent looking but no where near that count after months on there because I'm a guy.\n\n Out in clubs, in classes, in just normal life, it just seems like women have the luxury of picking from hundreds of guys and basically deciding who's worth their time while guys are left to scrap the bottom of the barrel. And women are extremely superficial, it's kind of a turn off. Idk shit gets me depressed. It's not that I'm not good looking or confident it's that I'm not Brad Pitt and have tons of cash.

Although I am not sure if it's that or maybe something else.\n\n* I feel anxious and nervous all the time. It feels like there is always something unknown on the horizon. Even during the holidays when I have literally nothing to do. I always feel like I should be doing something but I'm just sitting there doing nothing and it makes me feel awful. I'm sure you guys can relate.\n* I haven't made new friends in over 10 years, because I fear that I might be fundamentally different from everyone else, and that I cannot form a real connection with anybody. \n* Often this feeling of despair overcomes me. Like a grey wave of nihilism. I then don't see a reason to ever leave my room or really do or try anything because it seems pointless.\n* I'm falling behind in my studies, even though i love what I'm doing. There is this barrier that won't let me do any work. \n* General feelings of inadequacy, apathy towards myself, feeling useless and like a failure.  \n\nAnyways I can't go on like this (especially because I cannot focus on my studies, which are very important to me) and I want to get diagnosed and get some help (meds). However I'm unsure how to go about doing that.\n\nDo I just call my doctor and make an appointment specifically asking to get diagnosed about depression? \n\nDo I just make an appointment to discuss my mental health? If so what exactly do I say.? \n\nDo I call a therapist?",

I tried every medication you can emagine but nothing seamed to work.\nAbout a year ago I read about clinical trials being done with certain phycadelic drugs so I started researching..  I decided  it was worth a shot to at least try something new so I bought a legal chemical online that is almost identical to magic mushrooms called aco-dmt..\nOne morning I decided it was time and what I expected to be giggly or fun turned into the most spiritual experience of my life.. After my experience I had some type of different outlook on life and  started working again, my experience was lifechanging ..\nI do not recommend anyone with a mental illness over and beyond depression to do what I did.. I just wanted to share my story and possibly give some of you hope that life can change and depression can be lifted..",

My voice is not deep at all (I would describe it more as out of breath while slightly higher pitched). I cannot grow much facial hair. My legs are very skinny. My hands are tiny and so are my genitals. I\u2019m not tall nor broad.\n\nAnd while I can improve my muscles, my height, voice, hands, inability to grow a beard, and genital size are never going to change.\n\nAnd this has made me depressed since puberty: watching all my male peers grow larger and get girls and sleep around while I slowly became addicted to weed and alcohol and food to cope with the pain. I hate this body and I wish I could just be average, even.\n\nAdding to this is the fact that my current girlfriend (who I legitimately love more than anything) has had so much more experience and with those real men: tall, broad, hairy chest and face, big hands, deep voice, super muscular, big/thick cocks. So after already hating my own body, I\u2019ve come to find that i\u2019m not even close to bringing the same visual or physical pleasure that my girlfriend prefers. \n\nAnd it\u2019s so embarrassing and frustrating. I wake up every morning to images of her being pleasured by real men. I go through every waking moment feeling my inadequacy \nin my underwear or by standing next to taller men or hearing my own voice in comparison to average men. Everything triggers me and it sets me on a downhill spiral that ends in drinking and self harm. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible for me to have a good day because i\u2019m constantly reminded of how inadequate I am.\n\nDoes anyone have advice or am I just going to have to end it? I can\u2019t change my body and I just want it to go away. I want to go away.",

            "selftext": "I have failed my family. There\u2019s no other way to put it. I lost the only job I was good at and for the last year I haven\u2019t been able to find stable, full time employment. As a first year teacher I thought things were going well, but they weren\u2019t. I was teaching a subject I wasn\u2019t vetted for as is common in private schooling, along with the subject I was trained for. My mistake was taking the job in a private catholic  school. Now, I can\u2019t find a teaching job and I\u2019m afraid my career is over. The state I live in requires that I work full time in a classroom for four years or lose my license. I haven\u2019t been able to find a full time job to fulfill that requirement and I\u2019m not qualified for anything else. \n\nI have spent $57,000 on a bachelors and three masters degrees after the bottom fell out of my first career and I\u2019m lost. I have applications in at charter schools and public schools, I\u2019m no longer eligible to teach at private catholic schools because my contract wasn\u2019t renewed and I haven\u2019t been called once. My application seems to be looked over at every turn. I even have applications out at hospitals where I started out and can\u2019t get a call back. The ones who are suffering are my kids. My husband, God love him, doesn\u2019t want to hear about it anymore. He doesn\u2019t understand, neither does my mother. They honestly believe that I should walk into the district office and request an interview. They don\u2019t get that it doesn\u2019t work that way. \n\nI\u2019m sinking further and further into depression but I don\u2019t have good enough health insurance to cover the cost of treatment. I want to throw in the towel, to give up, to say I\u2019m done, but I don\u2019t want my kids to see I\u2019ve failed. I don\u2019t know what to do. The biggest slap in the face came from the principal who fired me when she said \u201cI know you\u2019re a good teacher, but we are going to let you go.\u201d It\u2019s a struggle to get up in the morning and go to the job that I do have, working with people who barely see my existence or worth. I\u2019m beginning to lose my worth and doubt my existence.",

My bf probably has BPD and he was abusive towards me a few months ago. I tried breaking up with him but he wouldn't let me and threatened to kill himself. I reached out to his parents for some help and they talked to him. I know it was the right thing but I feel so guilty and we've agreed to go no contact for a month. It's only been 3 days and I miss him so much. It just hurts so bad and i just don't want to feel anything anymore. I know my family would be sad but I don't think I can do it anymore. I feel like I've let everyone down. I just want it all to stop. I hate myself. This pain is too much.",

I haven\u2019t felt truly happy in a while and every good thing that happens to me ends up with me overthinking it until I\u2019ve turned it into something that makes me feel *worse*. I often wake up in the early hours of the morning and end up unable to get back to sleep because my thoughts are constantly reminding me of how everything good in my life will eventually end, and I can\u2019t take my mind off that.\n\nI\u2019m making this post because despite my efforts to fix things, it still feels like the depression is getting worse and worse. It\u2019s like I\u2019m doing a really bad job at walking through quick sand, and I\u2019m at a total loss. My depression doesn\u2019t seem to stem from negative thoughts about myself which is what a lot of the CBT I\u2019ve done seems to focus on. The depression I\u2019m feeling doesn\u2019t seem to have a trigger, I just feel absolutely miserable for seemingly no reason.\n\nI feel like a lost cause at the moment. I can\u2019t enjoy anything when I get home, like for example, video games. I find it very difficult to see the point in anything and this also affects my hobbies and chores. I honestly don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, it feels like I\u2019ve fallen down a huge pit and I can\u2019t climb back up. I\u2019m worried about the affect that this will have on my career and relationships if I can\u2019t get myself back into a state where my default emotion isn\u2019t crippling despair. Any advice is very much appreciated, I\u2019m based in the U.K. if that information helps.",

I just want to be normal, man. I'm always in my room, on my bed, on social media and taking naps. The same thing day by day for almost 2 years.

I have tried to see a doctor if anything is wrong with me but it's the same thing as always. I cant or wont let myself make it out of bed. I have tried hotlines, phone and text, but it doesn't work for me.\n\nI just want to live, I just want to make friends and do what friends do. I want to work and live life normally like everyone does but I know it's never normal inside, its different for everyone but at least they can actually get up and go out, go to work or school, to see friends or family or just go out for themselves.\n\nI talk to no one unless they talk to me first, not even my parents when they genuinely try to talk to me. And when that happens, I hardly ever respond.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me or if I'm just like this but I hate it. I hate what it's doing to people around me and myself.

They do love me but they don't like me. My sister doesn't give a fuck. She tries to get me caught for something I have done as many times as possible. Out of anger and frustration, I have broken some things in our house which makes my parents like me even less but they don't know it's out of anger. They usually assume it's because I want a new phone or graphics or something (I overheard them talking about this many times). I can't tell em about my state of mind and can't stop them from assuming those things. I used to have a friend who totally abandoned me and is never willing to come back. I really have broken a record. Should I be happy about it? Happy about that I managed to get everyone dislike me? Fuck me, right?",

            "selftext": "Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don\u2019t like what I see. I am ugly. I have an ugly face that\u2019s only getting worse because of bad sleep, an ugly body and ugly style. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there\u2019s no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don\u2019t like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I\u2019m this way, I\u2019m super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I\u2019ll never have the luxury of relationships, dates, anything. I\u2019ve never been loved and never will be loved (even on a family sense - my entire upbringing being another issue altogether that won\u2019t be the main focus of this piece). I dont have the luxury of being confident because by default I've been cursed with something that is forever lasting. Forever. From now until I die. This is the only life I have and I\u2019m stuck with this. \u00a0This is a part of my identity I\u2019m stuck with! I get depressed every time I thoroughly think about how I\u2019m stuck like this. I always want to cry. I can\u2019t feel cool no matter what I become because of this piece of me. There are so many disadvantages that come with being short, ugly and brown, I couldn\u2019t list them all. To sum all of those things up, more people want less to do with you than they would an average looking or attractive person and see you as beneath those other people. Anything that involves being face to face with another person affects ugly people. \u201cBe confident\u201d doesn't mean a thing to me. It's an imaginary idea. I have too many problems and insecurities and circumstances that make my life miserable. I don\u2019t like being associated with this ugly. I don\u2019t like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It\u2019s like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt you can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. The only way I can go outside is by forgetting that I\u2019m ugly somehow or by forcing myself by adopting a nihilistic mindset before leaving the house. I\u2019m tired of being beneath others and not good enough. And I can\u2019t do anything about this pain. On top of enduring this pain, I have to suppress it so that I don\u2019t hurt myself or become a danger to society. Being ugly isn\u2019t just something that holds you back. It\u2019s something that eats away at you. I can\u2019t do a thing about it. There are times when I don\u2019t even want to go outside because of the way I look. It\u2019s painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can\u2019t let being ugly take over. There\u2019s no solution to this. I just have to deal with it and the sadness that comes with it. Many people don\u2019t have to deal with this at all, so they don\u2019t have the solution for it or need a solution. No matter how much I explain how this feels, no one who isn\u2019t like me will ever understand what it\u2019s like. I\u2019m tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I\u2019m not ugly. They only say that because there\u2019s nothing else they can do or say to people when they\u2019re ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I\u2019m dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out on others but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.",

Ill try to give you some background on myself:\n\n\\&gt;Been in therapy and on and off SSRI's since middle school but never really got much out of it\n\n\\&gt;get through first 2 years of college hating every second of it, bust had full academic scholarship so just went\n\n\\&gt;Have a complete mental breakdown, cutoff all contact with family disappear\n\n\\&gt;Join the army, lie about all the mental health shit obv, leave 2 weeks later(I was reading a lot of Dostoevsky and loved the idea of an impure soul cleansing itself through suffering and labor)\n\n\\&gt;spend 4 years in the army abusing more hard drugs than I ever imagined would be possible and being a complete deprived degenerate\n\n\\&gt;Eventually get found unresponsive in my room from a cocktail of Valium, Oxycontin and vodka\n\n\\&gt;they call it a suicide attempt, but it honestly wasnt and I was doing this pretty regularly on weekends and holidays,  I honestly think I would have woken up on my own in another 12/24 hours but idk\n\n\\&gt;kicked out but still with a positive discharge because despite my internal mess, I can honestly say I was outstanding at my job and work\n\n\\&gt;moved home with parents, dont tell them about that stuff\n\n\\&gt;back to college next fall w/ GI bill\n\nPART 2:\n\n\\&gt;Meet super sweet girl who is literally in an Ivy league school graduate program\n\n\\&gt;we start hanging out and really like each other a lot\n\n\\&gt;I am totally confused as to her attraction to me, shes got her life so put together and I'm a complete loser\n\n\\&gt;we get really close, sleeping at her place a few nights a week, regularly going on cute dates and stuff\n\n\\&gt;not even gunna lie holding her hand or cuddling close to her in bed(i don't even care about the sex), is literally one of the best feelings in the world, literally comparable to the warmth of an opiate\n\n\\&gt;Shes so nonjudgmental and we've both opened up to each other about a lot of our personal issues and dreams and hopes, I feel like I can almost be something close to honest with her about myself(but its only a matter of time till she realizes she's hangin with a zilch and ditches me tbh)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut heres the catch:\n\nEvery time I see her, I literally cannot handle the emotions, like happy or sad are both too much for me.  Like the other day I was really happy after seeing her we had a super cute picnicking in a park by the beach, but my default response was to come home and take \"the ole faithful sleeping cocktail\" because I couldn't even handle the emotions.\n\nLike I couldnt even wait to drive home I had to stop at a liquor store and buy nips to drink on the way\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDont hate me I know many of you will say \"you cant be depressed your life is good youve got somebody who loves you and who you love\" and I would have agreed before, but its just not the case.  I literally cannot stop thinking about just wanting to not exist.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologize for wall of text and typos",

            "selftext": "My first time posting.\n\nI don't feel so good anymore ane I don't know exactly what caused this sudden change. I don't even know where to start I was the happiest person you could possibly imagine, I lived really healthy never drank alcohol never smoked stopped eating sugar and meat I worked out I had hobbies and everything seemed to be perfect, I had loving and supportive friends (i still have them) and also a loving mother and brother.\nBut 6 months ago i started to lose all my motivation. I didn't do anything anymore I stopped studying stopped going out stopped doing everything I loved except for playing video games and sleeping. I started to isolate myself in my room i stopped replying and i started to drink alcohol and taking drugs. I broke up with my boyfriend (im gay) my grades dropped from A and Bs to D and Fs, I stopped showering regularly (maybe once every two weeks) and I'm now always only in my room in the complete dark crying almost every day drinking in my room and I skip school almost every second day. No one knows how I feel everyone thinks I'm fine even if i was telling my issues to someone, i would not even know what to say because i don't know why I'm feeling this way rn. The only thing i can think of is that everything seems so boring, I'm living the same life for years, nothing new. I just want to run away every single day want to disconnect to everyone I know. I don't know how to help myself anymore. Can't even get up out of the bed. I'm literally in bed for 20 hours a day, my back even hurts my heart hurts. I can't even rest because I constantly feel anxious i can't even explain why, it even annoys me so much (the pumping racing heart) that i get anger attacks and I destroyed my closet door.\n\nI can't recognise myself anymore that's not who I am. I feel so tiny and lost. I slowly can't do this anymore. I don't want to be depressed i want to live. It feels so weird.\n\nI just wanted to talk about it for a little bit, at this point it feels like I can't even tell my closest friends what's going on in my life.",

            "selftext": "So first of all, sorry for posting here, I know there's probably a load of other people with much worse problems than I have, but cheers for reading.\n\nBasically I've had anxiety/depression issues for the best part of 15 years, but I've only recently come to realise that. I've lived in a cycle, being in control, then everything falling apart for the last 8 years or so. Right now I'm in the latter.\n\nBefore Christmas I found out my Mother is suicidal. She's got no family here, and here friends have moved away, so I obviously worried about her. At the same time my girlfriend's family have had a load of issues (breakups, proper serious mental health issues, premature baby) and I've been busy helping out where ever I can. Work got crazy busy, just out of control.\n\nAll of that just lead to me getting down, and crazy stressed. I'd lie awake at night just running through all the issues. So tired, stressed, my work had gone down the pan, I've made multiple mistakes that could cost the company more than my salary put together. So now I'm worried about my job in with all that. \n\nWork know about my mental health issues as of a few weeks ago, and have put a plan in place for me to sort things out. My problem is I just cant seem to focus. I'm constantly in a fog, I just cant seem to get thoughts through it. I look at sorting my mistakes and within 15 mins I have to go off and stop myself having a panic attack. My motivation has just hit rock bottom. Then I dont get enough done, go home and panic about losing my job. I go to bed, dont sleep, and end up irritable, snapping at people I care about, who are only going to take it for so long.\n\nI've tried the docs, got the pills and they're doing little enough. I've tried a counsellor through work who just keeps giving me breathing exercises when I call, which is next to useless. Don't suppose any of you have got through something similar? Any tips to just get on though things?",

            "selftext": "My mind has been racing at miles a minute so I am going to try and get it all out here.  I appreciate any and all feedback anyone is willing to give, but know that I'll be taking anything said with a grain of salt.\n\nI don't like to admit that I have depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.  I've tried to deny all of it for so many years that some of it is buried so far down.  I don't like crying or showing weakness.  \n\nEvery day I feel like a worthless husk of a human being.  No one will ever be willing to make the time to show me any care or reciprocate any of the feelings that I try to show them because I'm not worth their time.\n\nI've been told by a couple of the few friends that I have that I shouldn't lose hope, that I bring joy to their lives, and there is a part of me that wants to believe them.  Then there's this glaring sound in my head that tells me that they are only saying these things to try and use me for their own gain in the future.  \n\nI've been talking to a girl for over a month now, been falling head over heels for her, and hoping that I don't drive her away.  We went out recently and it was honestly the only day I think I've ever had like that in my life, I felt like I could do anything, and there was so much happiness and bliss from one day.  She explained to me that she was not a fan of physical affection, which I can understand, but she wasn't very specific.  I read it as she didn't like being touched or anything like that, which was wrong.  Her birthday was coming up and I had gotten her a gift, she seemed very happy with it, and I said to her \"You realize how hardly I'm restraining myself from hugging you, right?\" She was confused and told me that she would absolutely give me a hug.  I told her that I'd probably cry, and I did.  She hugged me and all felt right in the world.  I've never had anyone not bound by blood to care for me, emotionally or physically.  Typing it out now, I get a bit teary eyed because I can still almost feel her in my arms.  She messaged me the next day and thanked me for spending Easter with her.  She said that she felt treasured, and that it was something she hasn't felt in a long time. If I, as someone who has never done anything with a woman before, was unsure of what love felt like, I am pretty sure that day was a good starting point.  \n\nShe tried telling me that I've really helped her through the past month, and I can't help but feel like she is only saying this to try and make me feel better.  When I asked her if she'd be willing to stay around and support me while I try and work on myself, she said she absolutely would.  I asked her how she felt about the day that we had, and she said that she didn't feel anything special, but that she enjoyed spending time with me.  I rationalized that as we just met in person for the first time, so I wasn't expecting her to go crazy over me after that.  She also said that she hasn't dismissed me as a potential partner, but she certainly isn't off the market.  She went on to say that she doesn't think her career will make her a good partner any time soon, maybe for years.  In a moment of confidence I told her that she underestimates my patience, which is true.  The lengths that I would go to to have this woman in my life are immense.  What worries me is that when she finds someone better than me, which is very easily achievable, that I won't find another person like her again, ever.  This was all last night.  I told her goodnight and put down my phone, moments later to be assaulted by what I would think would be an anxiety attack of some sort, with a storm of thoughts plaguing my inner monologue.  She has tried to help me as much as she can. I feel like more of a burden with every message I send her.  Every minute of her attention that I get I feel like an annoyance.\n\nI am filled to the brim with self-doubt, self-deprecation, and an overall hate for myself as a human being.  I know that I'll never be good enough for her and that's the real knife twisting in my gut right now.  The only solace that I can even hope to take in this is that one day she will be happy.  It won't include me in her happiness though.  \n\nI have been trying to do some research on therapists in my area to try and work some of this stuff out with a professional, and maybe get some form of medication for it.  Getting motivated to start trying to care for myself, like I care about others is difficult.  \n\nIf you've made it this far, I thank you for your time in reading, and I hope that the sun shines brightly for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:  Piece of shit human being with no real hope for love or anything of the sort.  Hate myself.",

            "selftext": "Things were going well-ish.  I made progress in terms of motivation and wanting to improve, but then I suddenly got sucked into a deep existential crisis and . . . it's now 10 steps backwards.  My counsellor told me he almost gave up on me so many times and hearing that from him just broke my heart.  He's the only person I've confided in after my best friend and sister almost killed herself and was texting me as she was contemplating suicide.  I was a fucking CHILD.  She was someone I had met over the Internet and was the closest I had to a real sister (I have one, but we weren't close at all).  I'm just so done with being vulnerable in front of people.  We're all going to fucking die anyway, so I might as well bury everything deep again and hope that I kill myself fast enough so that all the shit doesn't come erupting up like Mount Vesuvius.\n\nI didn't even want to improve though.  That's the thing.  I don't think I'll ever 'improve' or 'learn how to deal with depression healthily'.  I'll just keep cutting my ankles, starving myself, purging every piece of food I eat, and when I'm old enough, probably drink or drug my life away.  Holy shit, I *want* to die over a heroin overdose.  It feels so much better than being alive and pretending to be happy when all I want to do is just not exist.  \n\nIs that fucked up?  I feel like it is.  Normal teenagers don't fantasize about overdosing.  I don't mean to romanticise it and I think it's shit that people have to turn to drugs to feel an ounce of happiness, but that's where I am now.  Nothing gives me joy.  Baking gives me an escape but that's rooted from my tendency to starve myself.  It's not authentic.  I don't know what to do.  I don't think I'll ever find joy or fall in love, and that makes me even more fucking miserable.  \n\nSorry.  Had to rant.  Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "I'm 23 years old and I am directing my life exactly in the direction that I plan for myself. I've been struggling with depression since I was 15, sometimes more sometimes less - lately, though, I've noticed more and more how the world generally frustrates me although my life is going better than ever. I have a job that I love and see as my calling - I'm a budding personal trainer and motivate people to get the best out of themselves. That really fills me, I'm surrounded by positivity. I have friends and family who support me in every situation and a wonderful, loving girlfriend that I also really love from the bottom of my hearth. When I think that my life at 18 felt like it was over already (i slept 16-20 hours per day at this time), I now have everything I need to be happy - but most of the time i am not, my \"happy-state\" is usually just 10% better then regular, even when i am with my girlfriend or while doing things i enjoy.\n\nWhy am I, despite everything that is going on for me right now, plagued by a frustration that seems to be getting bigger day by day. The world we live in is so incredibly fast - everything is so fast-paced. You work 5 days a week and have 2 days free. The weeks pass without you even noticing it and suddenly it's already new year again. Time's running.\n\nThe head never comes to rest - humanity is addicted to ever new impulses that distract from the essential. The egos of humans poison their character and they do not even notice it. Most people lack empathy. Narcissism, especially through the Internet, has reached dimensions that are more than ridiculous. Everyone seems to have the perfect life and they have to rub that in on everyone.\n\nThe self-perception and self-representation of the people is so far from reality and distorted that I would like to puke. Everyone is panting desperately for the attention of his 5000 \"friends\" on the internet. We are the most connected - yet most disconnected generation.\n\nI have the feeling that humanity is getting crazier every day. I do not read any news because 90% of them depress me even more and I realized that I feel better when I do not know about everything that happens in the world. It seems to me that the pure greed of a few plunges the whole world into ruin. Humankind is made addicted to consumption - we clear and litter everything until only an ash pile remains of our still beautiful planet.\n\nThat is how is feel - those are the thoughts that stick in my mind like a virus.

            "selftext": "I feel like such an ass posting here cause other people definitely have problems that need more attention but I just don't know where else to go. To sum up, I havent told really anyone in my life that I'm actually suffering from depression cause hello social anxiety but there was one person who is my best friend/housemate that I'd been trying to talk to.\n\nBasically just with the stress of uni/work and the shit tornado that is anyone's reaction whenever they get close to me I've been having a bad time the last week or so. I got stood up twice for a social thing for someone who I thought I was good friends with. Then I got stood up for the 5th time in a row by a date (5 different people in the last few months all somehow made last minute excuses and bailed on me half an hour before), I hadn't yet told my housemate/best friend cause she also struggles from depression and had been going well for a while and I didn't want to ruin that since she has been seeing a new guy who is really good for her and I knew bringing it up would send her into a spiral too. \n\nEssentially this guy she was seeing came over and hung out for a while, they got pretty drunk and we all went to bed, now the walls in our house are thin and I accidentally heard the whole conversation that went on in their room, skipping over the irrelevant bits, she said to him \u201cyeah but who would ever get with Ben?\" I know it was a Joke, it made sense in context, we banter about this a little ourselves and I'm ok with that cause it always felt like it was  a safe zone (20m never had a gf because was v overweight with no self esteem and was a dick as a defence mechanism before I started getting my shit together).\n\nI know it was a Joke but she was the only person I've ever felt safe enough with to even acknowledge my mental health issues, she helped me book my doctor's appointments to start seeing a psych (I have seen the gp but not the psych yet) and having to hear a total stranger defend me against my best friend hit me harder than anything else in my life. \n\nThe first night after I heard that I realised I felt so alone that I cried myself to sleep for the first time ever and the day after I had to mope around the house doing uni work until it hit me that I just didn't care what happened to me anymore. Thankfully I caught myself thinking that and that's when I really knew that I had a problem because I was genuinely considering just taking the whole pack of codeine tablets and not getting back up again so I've booked myself another doctor's appointment to get a referral for a psych appointment.\n\nEvery night since then I've gotten drunk because I'm so scared that once I start to spiral it just won't end and I'll wind up doing something I can't take back. It's been a week since then and it's happened every night I don't know who to talk to or where to go I have noone in my life I feel safe talking to and I'm struggling so much at the moment with my social anxiety that calling help lines makes me anxious to the point of physically being sick.\n\nI know I'm wasting everyone's time reading my sob story and I need to just work through it but I have nowhere else to go and I'm just scared of what I might do if I don't let some of this out.",

            "selftext": " \n\nSo basically my life has taken a turn, medically and psychologically. I won't go into it too much but basically I had a breakdown, the worst I have ever had in my entire life. Since then I can't enjoy life, I can't see the silver lining about what's happened to me medically (If it goes away). I just don't know what to think or feel. I miss laughing, I miss the way things the way they where, I miss me in general. I just am completely heart broken about when the way things have gone. I would look at old photos of myself laughing, smiling, having a good time with the friends I love and it makes me cry. I have said to myself out loud when looking at them \"Back when I was normal\". I just don't know what to do anymore, the only catharsis I have currently is drinking heavily. Not the smartest idea I know it just takes the pain away in consuming in excessive amounts, forgetting about things for awhile. I have strong suicidal thoughts sometimes, I am currently quite depressed more than anything. Recently I fashioned a noose to see if I could make one. I'm not entirely sure why I done it, I cannot describe it at all. It was like I was on auto-pilot with the intention to see if I could make one. It does disturb me to a degree, and hurts me too. I know I need help, I'ts just trying to figure out how I figure things out, and how I cope. So, that's why I am thinking about it really. I find it strange how I'll talk to my friends when they are feeling depressed, and sometimes give advice which I can't seem to follow. One of the only things that is holding me back is that I know it'll be painful for friends and family, I will transport pain onto them.\n\nThere's not much to tell about me really I'm 21, Irish, and from a city called Belfast in the North of Ireland. Where suicide is rampant, we are technically in the UK (don't ask why it's long, complicated, and bloody. just google \"The Troubles\" and the \"Partition of Ireland\") We have the highest suicide rate out of the rest of Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales. Also we have the most underfunded mental health service in the UK. Highest PTSD rate in Europe out of 30 nations. It's a recipe for sheer undiluted disaster, It disgust's me. We don't have an active government (Again google it). It seems like there is no hope for living here, we get a lot of tourists which is the only good thing really, because of Game Of Thrones, and in general wanting to see Ireland, and it's culture. which is the only nice thing to see really.\n\nThanks for your time.",

I don't really know. I guess I needed to say share my situation. I'm a medicine student who has had some anxiety problems in the past. My suspicion is that I've had some form of light depression (dysthimia) for some years, probably due to my first relationship with a guy and its consequences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I like my career, it's been the source of some anxiety problems. Lately I've been stabilized for some months, writing neutral stuff (writing is my own indicator for my emotional and psychological situation), but I've just realized I've been catfished by a guy I was talking to (for more than one month), and it's been the detonating for my inestability again. I feel alone, cheated, like an used toy. I feel useless. I feel like going back to my own cage of introspection and solitude and never going out again, even if my isolation causes me pain too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy final exams are in one month and I'm not going to be able to deal with it. I cannot sit down and study. I need to evade with music, anything but my responsabilities. The worst part is that my parents know nothing about this (my friends do) and I'm under pressure at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not waiting for a particular response, or a response at all. I just feel so vulnerable, useless and abulic today that I just cannot do anything to face it but express it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you if you've read me. I hope you're alright. I'm here too if you need to talk about your feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPablo",

I absolutely adore him. One of the reasons I got a dog was to help me not feel so lonely which he has but I don't spend enough time with him. Dogs don't live for very long and I want to spend as much time with him as possible.\n\nI want to travel Europe. I'm not trying to contradict my last point but, I would love to take a few weeks to travel Europe.\n\nI want to be fitter. I try to do this now, but I find that I'm very tired after a day at work and I don't have the energy to put much effort into it.\n\nI want a GF. I've never had a girlfriend, but I would like to put in the time to put myself out there.\n\nIf I lived on my own and was more independent, I would do this in a heartbeat, but I live with my parents and they rely quite a bit on my income to help pay for bills. I do feel I have enough money saved up to do this, but getting my parents approval is the hardest as they think I would just lie in bed all day for year as that's what they've always thought of me.\n\nWhat do you think I should do?",

I don't really know. I needed to say share my situation. I'm a medicine student who has had some anxiety problems in the past. My suspicion is that I've had some form of light depression (dysthimia) for some years, probably due to my first relationship with a guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I like my career, it's been the source of some anxiety problems. Lately I've been stabilized for some months, writing neutral stuff (writing is my own indicator for my emotional and  psychological situation), I've just been catfished by a guy I was talking to (for more than one month), and it's been the detonating for my inestability again. I feel alone, cheated, like an used toy. I feel useless. I feel like going back to my own cage of introspection and solitude and never going out again, even if it causes me pain too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy final exams are in one month and I'm just not able to deal with it. I cannot sit down and study. I need to evade with music or videogames, that's literally all I feel like doing now. The worst part is that my parents know nothing about any of this (my friends do) and I'm under pressure at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not waiting for a particular response, or a response at all. I just feel so vulnerable, useless and abulic today that I just cannot do anything to face it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you if you've read me. I hope you're alright. I'm here too if you need to talk about your feelings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPablo",

The silver lining was I went to a therapist and started learning what it means to be an adult child of an alcoholic. Additionally my therapist and I agree that I\u2019ve been high functioning depressed for a while. I\u2019ve been learning about my commitment issues and survival skills (good and bad ones). And it\u2019s helping though it\u2019s just a start to a long journey. \n\nI\u2019m a very goal oriented person and when I get focused on something, I almost become obsessed with it. Usually for the better, I can tell you everything you never wanted to know about space flight. This recent understanding of myself and sharing with close friends has opened a lot of insight to my condition as well as several close friends. It seems like 2019 is a crappy time for lots of folks. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been to my therapist once a week, and it\u2019s helping. However I work away from home for a month at a time offshore (doesn\u2019t help and may be a big part of my depression and loneliness). I\u2019m taking active steps to change my work situation and that may come to fruition sooner than later, won\u2019t know for a few more weeks. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone can recommend resources about understanding depression, ACA, and perhaps self help guides or exercises for dealing with them and loneliness while I\u2019m away. I have access to internet. \n\nTL;DR\nAway from home and my therapist and friends for long time, looking for resources for self help with depression and loneliness. \n\nThanks",

Last year I promised myself I will try to not miss out on anymore school and instead the complete opposite happened, I missed out on even more school. I can\u2019t seem to study at all, it\u2019s too overwhelming. I am seeing a psychologist and began taking antidepressants a little over a month ago since I felt like I hit rock bottom and wanted to give it a go. things haven\u2019t really changed much, I know it\u2019s still early days but I feel hopeless. I thought that if I did atar (I live in Australia, it\u2019s pretty much a ranking system used to get you into university) things might change and I\u2019d be more motivated to go to school, but that didn\u2019t happen and I ended up dropping out of atar. One of the deputies talked to me saying that a lot of my teachers were complaining about the amount of school and tests I\u2019ve been missing and that I\u2019m really far behind. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice? Has anyone had any troubles dealing with school while depressed?",

I don't want to hear him, see him or nothing but i only want to come out of my room to use the bathroom and take a bath that's it but the rest i just want to eat or sleep. That is why i don't want to be in Georgia and always end up leaving but this summertime i want to move if i want to because i am tired of him putting me down holding me back. Wherever i move this summertime i would get to listen to my music out loud, travel, go to wrestling events and get out more since i can't move to north Carolina because i have nobody to help me there. I will have no way to get around there, no friends or nothing so it will be better if i go back to the guy i always been with 3 years going on 4 years now to Kansas this summer because i need a change of scenery no matter how he treats me or not. I always stay to myself because i feel the need to because i am not a very social person because i am shy, nervous, quiet and i care too much what people think of me because of my depression also being slow in the head because i can't think fast or even learn fast like a normal person. I am always weak, tired, moody and the same thing everyday my stepdad don't understand so i suggest he just leaves me alone. I don't want to be around my stepdad the way he puts me down, calling me names or not which he did and also accuse me of stuff i don't do. i wasn't meant to stay in Georgia my whole life because i don't like being stuck in the same place and cluttered because that is how but at the same time i hate being alone where i have nobody to talk to but my huge problem is opening up not knowing what to say because all i do is stay in my cry, eat, sleep if i don't feel like doing much of nothing and lost of interest of doing things i use to love to do but i got no best friends like friendship goals like i always wanted to have but my boyfriend is the only one who i talk to but it don't matter how he treats me. i don't care about talking to people if people is not going to reply to me fast or people reject me when it is okay to be alone but at the same time i need someone to talk to . I want a long conversation but i feel nobody likes me because if i get insulted it would cause me to go off and get angry when my depression including my anxiety makes me feel the way i do but i just can't help it when i want to be liked for who i am also what i say and do. What does make me happy is wrestling, makeup, listening to music, going out to eat, shopping and going out as long as i don't go out to get in the middle of fear and violence is why mostly when i hear about this shootings even robberies that makes me scared to even want to go out is why i always stay in my room everyday when my mom goes to work. I take medication and it seems to be worst but i still have no energy unless i drink coffee or anything with energy but later on i am tired again.",

No biggie though, I mean we still have a nice view. But sometimes, life keeps sending clouds and our skies start to become darker and darker. Nothing that we can change, but we know that it\u2019s temporary so we\u2019ll move to higher ground and wait it out. After a while the clouds lift, and it\u2019s sunny again. You see, it all runs in cycles and that\u2019s life. \nDepression comes into place when those clouds roll in over a longer period of time. And instead of it storming and leaving, it slowly becomes darker and darker, but it never rains, just overcast. \nOvertime, you start to forget how those clear, sunny skies felt. Over days, months, even years, the overcast starts to just become your norm. It\u2019s dull, bleak, but it\u2019s not raining so we will just deal with it. Here\u2019s where to deception comes in. Those sunny skies never actually leave. They\u2019re always there but to you, because of those clouds, the overcast is just reality now. I mean, it\u2019s not like we can control those clouds, right? \nWhen you decide to seek help with your depression, it\u2019s like hopping on a plane. It\u2019s only a quick view, but you realize that \u201cWow. This reality I\u2019ve known for so long was only a superficial layer that I couldn\u2019t see through.\u201d \nYou start to figure out what those dark clouds were actually made of and they start to slowly separate. But only if you\u2019re focusing on understanding those clouds. Overtime, that bright blue starts to shine through! \n\nIf you\u2019re seeing nothing but clouds, you have to realize that peace of mind and happiness hasn\u2019t left you.

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve been struggling a little more than usual. I don\u2019t know, a lot of things have been brought up for me again. I\u2019m not reacting in the best ways and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m spiraling. \n\nI haven\u2019t been eating or sleeping and I\u2019ve been drinking more than usual. It was all really easy to skim over at first but now things are starting to compact. I realized earlier last week that I needed help again but at the start of this week I had a new work schedule that was more days than I was willing to work and hours that directly conflicted with my only weekly activity, originally recommended to me by my therapist to help with recovery from a suicide attempt. I told my boss that this was an issue and a concern of mine and I was told I needed to \u201creevaluate my priorities\u201d. \n\nThis lead to a long night of insomniac thinking where I realized if I right out quit that job that I would only make 1,200 dollars a month and that would mean I could apply for single payer healthcare which could potentially save my life at this point. \n\nMy rent is 700 and I feel like this is risky but it also opens me up to picking up additional hours at my other job which provides healthcare once I reach full time. \n\nThis is a job that I love but I\u2019m really unwell right now and it was wrong of my boss to shove so many extra hours on me and not talk to me about if first. They actually had a work meeting about all of this tonight that I was excluded from. There are as many red flags at this job as there are in my current behavior patterns and I would be a fool to let either continue. \n\nMy parents hate that I have been seeing a therapist and taking meds and they are pretty vocal about it, I\u2019m not going to tell them this time, as I feel like going off meds and leaving therapy was partly facilitated by them and the things they said. \n\nI recently took a trip with someone who also struggles with mental illness although of a different flavor than mine is. But seeing how proactive they were about taking care of themselves and communicative with their therapist and others in their therapy-group. It was really inspiring to see them do all of that and do so well with everything. No one is perfect and we all struggle but taking care of yourself and doing what\u2019s best for yourself is so important. I\u2019ve really been neglecting that. \n\nI got off social media for a while because I felt like it was a burden on my psyche and I often times would find myself in arguments about dumb things. I\u2019ve culled a lot of social media out of my life over the past year but I\u2019ve recently come back to reddit, in part because I felt stupid watching ask reddit videos on YouTube and also my friend I mentioned previously was a big proponent of using social media to build a support group for oneself and the more I think about how cut off from everything I\u2019ve become and I worry that I won\u2019t be allowed at my main hangout anymore because it\u2019s also the job I\u2019m quitting. \n\nI\u2019m very distraught and I know this is all rambling and awful because I\u2019ve had more alcohol than food again and not enough sleep at all.",

I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it\u2019s normal to feel empty. It\u2019s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I\u2019m alone in this? It\u2019s weird. I tell myself things like, \u201cthis isn\u2019t because of the depression, it\u2019s because you\u2019re worthless and incapable of doing anything.\u201d I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing. But deep down I would give anything in the world to feel happiness. \nI hope this isn\u2019t just me. Like deadass, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the only person who feels like this.

            "selftext": "Ive had terrible social skills since my childhood and therefore basically no real friends my entire life. Of course that also means ive never been in a relationship either. Ive had 'friends' throughout my University years. Ive been alone so long that ive got used to it. Ive pretty much accepted that ill never find anyone and ill probably die alone. \n\nI went for therapy for a couple of months earlier this year  and was prescribed medication.  In retrospect it didnt really help me whatsoever. The only benefit from therapy was me realising that ive basically been in a state of functionl depression for nearly a decade. I was just paying someone to listen to incoherent rants about why my life sucks.\n\nEver since I graduated from high school my life has been pointless. Ive made all the wrong choices and taken all the wrong  decisions. Ill be going abroad in a few months to do a masters in a subject I dont want to study. Ive never done anything and dont have any marketable skills other than being a 'straight A student' and the ability to endlessly binge Anime. Its like all the motivation and ambition I had slowly seeped out of me after high school.\n\nI dont see a point in my life. Ive basically done nothing the last two years after I graduated other than passing a professional exam that I wrote. I have 4 months before I leave. Everything I do is merely an attempt to distract myself from the drudgery of my meaningless, mediocre life and find temporary happiness. There's so much regret and unsatisfied desires suppressed in me that it's about all I can do right now to keep myself from having another break down. When im around other people in a social setting I seem fine. I talk to people, I laugh at jokes and feel happy for a while. The minute I go back home the depression sets back in. Ive realised ill never truly be happy. Happiness is elusive and fleeting. I dont see a point in living for the few moments where I dont wish I was Dead. I cant even remember the last time I was truly excited about something. My birthdays are meaningless. I dont really have many friends to celebrate it with and its just a reminder of another year where ive neither done nor achieved anything worth mentioning. \n\nIve stopped therapy and ive ceased taking my medication because ive fallen back into the apathetic state ive been in for as long as I can remember. I just dont care about anything or anyone truly. I feel like a terrible human being who doesnt really de serve companionship. Im incapable of really intimacy and love. \n\nIll never be anything or anyone. Ill never achieve anything because all I do when im not watching anime or playing video games is daydreaming about what my life would be like if I wasnt so socially awkward that I cant even hold a decent conversation with someone of the opposite sex.\n\nIm not even bad looking - or so ive been told by others - and dont really want for money. I feel like i dont even have a right to be depressed. The couple of friends I still have have gone through much worse and still persevere and endure. Everything bad in my life is my own fault. I have no one to blame and no circumstances which fucked me over. Everything is my fault. Nothing will change anymore. It's too late. I couldve done something, maybe been someone. But I chose to be a loser and a waste of oxygen because I never saw the point in anything. Life is just a drag. Id rather not exist, but I dont want to kill myself either. I didnt ask to be born, but I cant end my existence by my own hand because it will hurt the few people who care about me. The advice my parents gave me whenever I had a hard time was basically, 'dont be a pussy, deal with it cause we've gone through much worse'.\n\nI dont really know why im submitting this post. I guess I just hope in vain that something will make me feel better or will change things. But I know inside that nothing will. Ive pretty much resigned myself to this mediocre, pathetic life.\n\nSorry for the pointless rant.",

            "selftext": "Tried to post this on askreddit so i can get the most responses but the no body text rule deleted it and reddit told me i was posting too much and made me wait 2 min to post so im not having a good time. Anyways heres the story. One of my closest friends is suffering from depression and has tried to commit suicide multiple times and has failed. After is grandpa died about a year or two ago he has been crushed. He has tried to reach out to his friends from his battlefield clan and shockingly they made fun of him and didn't believe it. On top of that they told him to go die and to do it already pussy etc. These were his close friends and they betrayed him. I was furious and wanted to give them a piece of my mind but my friend said to leave it be. Now all the people who knew about his depression was me and a few other close friends from his clan. A few months later and we learns that some of the close friends were talking behind his back and saying things like \"im sure hes just trying to get attention, hes fine\". To make things worse one of the \"friends\" (who ill call ross) has a gf who suffers from depression as well but she said to ross that apparently to her my friends faking it and she can tell from how he talks (which makes no sense since he explained that he pretends to be fine so no one knows). Ever since then he lost basically all his close friends and only has a few acquaintances left other than me and our original group of friends who have been friends for 7+ years. Now hes at the peak of his suicidal tendencies. He plans to kill himself on may 1st if he doesnt get any second thoughts on it. The main thing pushing him over the edge other than the friends thing is his lack of self confidence. He is a very smart person and very capable, but he thinks hes not gonna succeed in life and doesnt believe me when i say that he can get through this. Is there any way i can get him to realize that he is a great person and that he can succeed? I will get back to you all around 11 30 est when i wake up, have a good day.",

It has been painful being lonely and isolated for this extreme length of time, no one to talk too, just sitting in my room playing games and surfing the web. For a while escapism worked. I could forget about me and my life for long periods. Now it doesn't work anymore.... \n\nI have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to find company, and that nobody will ever be interested in talking to me, and nobody will ever like me. I will continue to suffer alone until I die, possibly of a black heart. I don't care anymore, I always relish the idea of finishing this worthless life and finally being a peace.",

It saddens me to see people discuss such a meaningless topic as to which party they support when the Earth is going to die out in a few hundred years anyways.\n\nI mean is there really a point to all this? War is only inevitable given mankind's history. And at the rate we are contributing to the planet with our pollution, the human species will go extinct soon anyways or perhaps the planet will just 'die out'.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather just live out my life trying to enjoy each precious moments for what they are and try to give and hell others as much as I can. But sometimes it just all feels rather pointless in the grand scheme of things.\n\nCurious to hear what others think.",

            "selftext": "Hey, before depression took over my life I used to be such a happy person - joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isn't a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first I thought it's only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldn't enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. That's when I realized that \"bad phase\" was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was \"this is almost acceptable\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started to watch netflix again, play video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasn't even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation (along with sleeping) and because I knew that's what I'm supposed to do when I get fired but I didn't really felt much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it and then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree, and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I feel like **this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete**. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I can't sustain that, like the old-happy-me is visiting sometimes but she doesn't wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now (great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship) I am mostly anxious and scared. I can't be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like \"you'll never go back to what you used to be before depression\", \"depression leaves a scar you'll have to live with your entire life\", \"depression is a part of growing up, you just can't go back\". I am starting to believe these things and it's sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?",

            "selftext": "This feels like the dumbest thing to complain about in the world. I\u2019m married to someone I love very much, just moved across the country to a new place I love very much, and just got what is the closest thing to my dream job I can achieve without a college degree. It took a lot of convincing to get my relatives and friends back in my home state to get them to believe I was going to be fine, and they\u2019re all so proud of me. But I feel like I\u2019m messing it all up. \n\nMy job doesn\u2019t really pay enough to cover much more than the bills, and not really even that. I\u2019m accumulating a ton of credit card debt in the process of trying to stabilize. My husband\u2019s chronic illness is flaring up BAD, so he hasn\u2019t really been able to work or function in general, and it\u2019s really really hard to watch him struggle and be in so much pain and not be able to do anything about it because I don\u2019t have money to get him to a doctor and he doesn\u2019t have health insurance (my work doesn\u2019t have spouse coverage, which is bs, and I manage to make just enough money that we can\u2019t get on Medicaid). \n\nAll I can think about it how much easier it would be if I had a degree in my field for the job I\u2019m basically doing anyways, but I don\u2019t have the time or money to go to school, so I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to just be treading water for forever. I talk about how my job barely covers the bills, but with a high school degree, I can\u2019t get literally anything else that will pay me this well, give me health insurance, and not decimate my mental health.\n\nThe worst part is, I LOVE my new job. Like, I get to do super fulfilling work at an amazing place with amazing people, it\u2019s all I could possibly ask for. The fact that I\u2019m stressed out by it is UNBELIEVABLY stressful, because what else am I supposed to do? I\u2019m really stressed out already, and my mental health is falling apart (yes I have meds, yes I have a therapist who I see weekly), but there\u2019s nothing to be done about it because it doesn\u2019t get better than this. There\u2019s no \u201cwell maybe I can switch careers!\u201d or \u201cwell maybe I can move!\u201d because I did that, I\u2019m here, this is everything I want! \n\nBut then, this morning my husband pointed out that I\u2019ve been going into work later and later (I can flex my hours), and that I\u2019ve been picking a lot of Internet fights with people, and that I\u2019ve been staying up really late. I almost broke down. Like, man, nobody was supposed to notice that. I was supposed to just ride this out and everything will just be normal and I\u2019ll adjust and we\u2019ll be okay, maybe next paycheck or the one after that or the one after that. \n\nI\u2019m supposed to be happy. I\u2019m supposed to be fulfilled. I\u2019m doing everything right. I go to therapy, I\u2019m on meds, I do DBT, I try to have hobbies whenever I have time, why am I so miserable??? \n\nPeople have been noticing that I\u2019m kind of disintegrating and I have no idea what to do to fix it or help assuage their concerns because I\u2019m doing literally everything I can and it\u2019s still not working. I\u2019m at a total loss, and everything feels so hopeless. Maybe I\u2019m just broken, and it never gets better for me, and I never get to be happy. I\u2019m so numb and I\u2019m not able to do my job or be a good partner or good to myself and there\u2019s absolutely no way out. I\u2019m so ashamed. I\u2019m supposed to be the one that has their shit together and knows what to do and is strong and capable and everyone trusts me to be that, but I can\u2019t right now and for the foreseeable future, and what even am I worth if I can\u2019t keep myself and the people I care about above water? I have nobody to talk to about these feelings because I don\u2019t wanna worry anyone and I have no solution to offer to any of this at all, and I don\u2019t know my new therapist here well enough to get it out there even. \n\nSometimes I wish something terrible would happen to me, like I\u2019d get hit by a truck or come down with a life-threatening sickness or the train I\u2019m on would catch on fire so I\u2019d have an excuse to heal without having to admit I\u2019m in over my head and have nowhere to turn. I don\u2019t know. None of this makes sense and I\u2019m so so so lonely.",

            "selftext": "So I tried to make a post over on r/offmychest, but for some reason it wasn't showing up on the subreddit. I messaged the mods about it but after almost two weeks I haven't gotten any reply. This is more or less just a x-post for a post that was never actually posted.  I haven't been on this sub much and didn't see anything on the sidebar or a stickied post about the subs rules, so I hope thats ok.\n\nI don't want to come off as if i'm just looking for attention, but I don't have anyone else to talk to about this. \n\nIts very late where I am so if anyone leaves a comment I won't be able to reply until maybe tomorrow afternoon. I'll try to respond earlier if i can.\n\n\n\nI'm going to be 23 years old; I have no friends, and haven't had any since elementary school. I have never been in any kind of romantic relationship or been in love with anyone. (I'm also a virgin, but that doesn't bother me nearly as much) My only real social interaction is with my mother, who I still live with. (mostly because she needs my help with paying groceries and such, and also because trying to talk to her about moving out just ends in a fight) After I spent my last birthday alone, I made a promise that I would off myself if I couldn't get my shit together by the next one.\n\nWhen I'm at work all I can think about is killing myself. I keep having these fantasies where I shoot myself in front of all my coworkers. Another I often have is of me going into the kitchen and slicing my throat open with our bread knife. At this point I doubt I'd ever actually go through with it, but I get so overwhelmed with emotion that I just need some form of catharsis to get through the day. When it gets really bad I'll sneak off to the bathroom and hit myself in the leg repeatedly or start biting my hand. I often wish I could do something like shooting myself in the head but live through it. Getting to feel a bullet pierce my skull and then pop out the other side would be very cathartic I'd imagine.\n\nThe only emotions I ever feel anymore are anger and sadness. I can still laugh at a joke and shit like that, but whatever happiness it brings is fleeting.\n\nLately I've been losing my temper at work. Its embarrassing and makes me feel terrible afterwords, but I just get to this point where I can't hold it in anymore. I don't really hate my job at all, or my coworkers. I actually kind of like it. The truth is that all this emotional bullshit stems from my own failures that i'm not strong enough to address.\n\nI don't understand how I let my life get this pathetic. I don't understand how I've never been able to form anything resembling an intimate, emotional relationship. It hasn't been for a lack of trying. I keep thinking back to middle school, to how no matter how hard I tried, no one would give me a chance. I wish I could meet them today and just ask what I did wrong.\n\nI want to experience friendships before its too late. Basic shit like going out to eat or staying up late just talking about whatever. Just enjoying each others company, sharing experiences together. I'm nearly halfway through my twenties and have nothing to show for it, no real experiences or stories to tell. When you reach you're late twenties/early thirties people start to have kids, careers, you don't really get to have friends at that point. At least not in the same way. This is my only chance left and every hour of every day I'm living I'm wasting.\n\nI don't even think I would be happy with friends or romance at this point, they'd probably stress me out. But I don't really care about being happy much anymore. It feels pointless to chase some fleeting emotion when some chemical balance in my brain is just going to make me miserable no matter what. But if I had those things I would at least be normal. I think that's all I really want at this point, to be a normal person that isn't a waste of life.\n\nThe only time I can think of where I was consistently happy was fourth grade. I had a nice group of friends, I had a teacher that had a lot of faith in me and my future, I was optimistic about how life was going to play out. Back then I loved drawing and writing stories. I remember my teacher used to read them to the class and she would let me show off all my dumb drawings. She told my mom once that she would read them to her kids at night before bed. By middle school I had stopped drawing and writing. I never really did anything between middle and high school honestly. I tried really hard to fit in during middle school and with high school I did my best to just blend into the background.\n\nFor the past couple of years I've been trying to get back into these things, to try and reignite some kind of creative drive. I can't write for shit and can only draw adequately well, and I can barely motivate myself to work at either. Part of me still wants to try and do some sort of creative project, but I have no real imagination anymore. I have a few ideas that I like but they're all half-baked and I can't for the life of me flesh them out into anything unique or interesting.\n\nI also feel like I'm too old to do anything like that. There are a lot of artist that I admire and look up to that end up being a good three to four years younger than me. And the ones that aren't where that age when they started. When you're young doing something like a webcomic or just messing around with writing can be charming. But if it isn't something you have been consistently doing and you're like 24 then I feel it would come off as weird. people stop seeing it as cute after that.\n\nI don't even want to do this kind of thing for something fame or whatever. If I made something I doubt I would even share it online. (except maybe as a way to make friends) At this point I feel like I just need some sort of emotional outlet, but I'm not smart enough to translate anything I feel into something like a story or art.\n\nI keep thinking back to that teacher I had, about how disappointed she would be to see me in this state. She told me she believed I would become an animator or comic artist one day, that I had too much talent and passion for art not to be. If i ever met her again and she found out who I was I would just kill myself. I wouldn't be able to handle the guilt of being such a disappointment.\n\nMy mom and grandma keep pressuring me to go to art school and get some sort of job in art, as if I can just do that with the little shred of talent I have. They're incapable of seeing me as anything other than perfect. They constantly shower me in praise for the slightest thing, constantly tell me that I'm smart and good looking and all this dumb bullshit. Its so fucking humiliating and condescending. They've been doing it my whole life. Part of me thinks its all a sham, they know I'm a loser and they feel the need to say this shit to me because I'm too weak and fragile to handle anything else. Maybe deep down they resent me and want to build me up just for life to knock me down.\n\nI remember when I was in school I would try and talk to my mom about what I was going through. She would just laugh it off and say I was over reacting. I was actually the nicest and friendliest kid in school and everyone would want to be my friend. My problem apparently was that I was too mature for my age. I just had to wait a year, then they would be mature enough to see just how much of a sweet boy I was. She told me that shit every year right up until graduation and I bouht into it every time.\n\nThis thing is getting way to long and I don't really know how to end it. I've spent like, four days writing this post trying to not make it sound like I'm a psychopath. I don't even know why I wrote this in the first place, It hasn't made me fell any better. I've wasted the entirety if my teen years because of my awful social skills, and now i'm wasting my twenties. I feel broken and I don't know how to fix myself.",

I've never seen the Harry potter movies, so i bought them all on special. I'm watching them with my sister, day by day. Today we watched the fourth one.\n\nBut after every movie, I get into a major slump and just feel so depressed it's unbearable. I have no idea what's causing it.\n\nMaking things worse, I feel kind of isolated. I don't have many friends left to talk to, most of them have had falling outs or moved away, so I'm left with no social life. I live with family, so I'm not totally alone.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. I've doubled my SSRIs, and I really want to finish the series, but it's got me down like no other.\n\nAny advice?",

People have already settled in just fine into their new lifestyle made new friends and seem more or less on top of things. Meanwhile I'm struggling a lot to adapt. I've made only one friend so far (he's a cool guy not complaining there) but he's so much more outgoing than me I'm worried after a while he'll realise he has far better options than hanging out with me. I have tried to mix with the other people in my class but it seems like I'm everyone's least favorite person. I'm not bullied. I'm just ignored. And I have actually tried to get myself noticed. Sometimes whenever my friend is having a chat with someone else I join in but it feels like I'm unwanted by the other party. Or sometimes I have nothing to say. Most of my friendships up until now were formed by either common interests or humour. And my humour seems to miss the class in general, and my interests include movies and drawings, which again; doesn't seem to be anyone elses interest in the class.  Friendships formed by other means rarely lasted if formed. I can't even really foster the friendship I do have right now because my mind is so often completely blank due to all this stuff.\nI wouldn't even care this much if I was studying something I really enjoyed but I'm not. I'm studying something that's \"fine\". I'm fine with pursuing this but it doesn't give me any real thrill like some subjects back in secondary school could. \nI don't remember making friends being this hard. Everyone has already succeeded and here's me being a pathetic shit. \nI'm planning on joining a student club in photography later, to hopefully meet some nice people and pursue an old hobby of mine but I'm so beaten down that I don't feel anything anymore.\nTldr; I can't make any friends in my new school apart from one super extroverted dude, who I'm pretty sure won't wanna hang with me after a while and studies can't even distract me from this.",

            "selftext": "I'm (32M) suffering from mild to heavy depression depending on the days. It seems to me that most contributors here are teens or twenty-somethings. \n\nI'm looking for people in their 30s or 40s suffering from depression. How do you deal with it? \n\nIn my case, it's kind of weird. Life hasn't been particularly bad at all since I turned 30. In many ways, life is better because I have a steady job which allows me to afford certain pleasures such as going on interesting trips.  Physically I feel pretty much the same, eventhough I've noticed that I gain weight faster if I'm not careful and that I have  sometimes a few little joint pains here and there. But the differences are very marginal and there isn't anything I could do in my twenties which I can't do now in my thirties. When I compare my current situation to my twenties, it really is better.    \n\n\nIn my twenties, I was kind of lost... I was stressing about exams. I had no idea where my life was heading. I spent a big chunk (3 to 4 years) of my twenties doing shitty unpaid internships and job searching, going from failed interview to failed interview. So I'm not idealizing my twenties at all. Despite a few good memories, alot of it sucked big time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now at 32, despite having a better life overall, I feel very sad and unsatisfied. I'm not so anxious, as I was in my 20s, about which direction my life is taking. I rather feel a sort of hopelessness... is this all life has to offer? What is the point?  \n\nAlso, I'm now conscious of how fast time flies. Even 10 years is not alot of time, it flies by.  I wasn't really aware of that when I was in my twenties and it gave me hope that at least I had a lot of time ahead of me. Now I realize that in 10 years, the same period of time that went by since I was 22, I'll be 42. I was 22 yesterday. It is very scary and generates lots of anxiety. \n\n  \nWatching my friends settle down and having kids is also a source of depression. I'm gay so probably will never have this joy of having a family. At least, I still have a group of gay friends who are single like me..so it helps. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut life mostly feels dull and despite being 32, which is still young in the grand scheme of life, I often feel like life is over and that from now on, I will only get older and older as well as increasingly lonely and hopeless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fears suck and I sometimes don't feel like living this life anymore. My parents are still healthy and not too old yet. But I don't feel the courage to see them get old and sick. They are mostly all I have in terms of family. My brother has his own life. \n\nAnyway, these are mostly the fears I'm going through. Anyone feeling the same way?",

I have a beautiful, amazing girlfriend, [23F], we met at work and have been going out for over two months. We attend church together every Sunday, practice regularly. It\u2019s an amazing life. Family life is good, has its moments and drama, but I don\u2019t feel as close as I should due to issues on either side of the family. I\u2019ve struggled with depression for most of my teenage years as well, it\u2019s been a rollercoaster. Since I\u2019ve been living alone, it\u2019s been quite hard. I don\u2019t have many friends that I see on a regular basis, I really just look forward to going to work everyday and seeing my girlfriend. I know I have a great life, but it always kills me, God has given me all of this, and I feel no change in my inner feelings as far as my depression goes. Yes, I have happy days, me and me lady love each other, she knows that and treats me so well and is so supportive. I always find myself letting it all out when I get home after a great day, realizing I\u2019m all lone, left to be with my thoughts and I find myself no longer thinking about the amazing day I had at work, or with my girlfriend, or just how happy I was in general, I\u2019m always left feeling so empty, and lonely. Sleeping beside my girlfriend really fills this hole I seem to have in my stomach, we aren\u2019t moving in together as we are waiting until marriage. That\u2019s hard to wait for some days, but I\u2019m trying. I find myself lying to others about how I feel, mainly because I feel like this at least once throughout every single day, and who really wants to be bothered with that? Who would want to bug someone you love, everyday, letting them know that no matter how happy they\u2019ve made me today, I\u2019ll still feel like shit tonight? Who wants that? I\u2019ve just started to see a therapist, hoping it continues to go well and I\u2019ll get started on a prescription soon. Anyways, I just had to get this out on this sub as this seemed like the best way. Thanks for reading.",

            "selftext": "As far back as I can remember, I always searched to find the good and bad in everything to help assess my next step, but mostly had an enjoyment for thriving in misery somewhere in the mix of all this. I usually notice the bad first before the good as a way of always being \"one step ahead\" in things as if everything is a competition of some sort, which may have contributed to most of my problems today after allowing it to internally grow over the years. Due to this, and I may be wrong, I believe its led to building a naturally-detached behavior towards others believing that I simply don't need anyone, ever. From this mentality, a lot of great things have occurred, such as becoming a self-made millionaire by 22, excelling in all my hobbies at a professional level, and being a very logical and level-headed person in all-aspects of life (or so it actually seems to others on the outside). However, a lot of negative outcomes have derived from this and a lot of missed opportunities as well. I can't properly connect with other people of the same gender without the worry of being too exposed and strictly keeping it to an acquaintance/business level and couldn't imagine forming a relationship with the opposite gender so I simply ghost them at any chance I can to avoid intimacy for no solid reason other than mental gymnastics. At first, I thought I had everything figured out and my constant down-attitude was just from the stress of being a \"perfectionist\" in everything I do, but slowly as time passed, I've began to learn that I'm also far too isolated and lonely. I began to address this issue head-on by dropping this intimidation/too-good-for-you attitude in a genuine way, not as a temporary thing where I try to string people along for my own benefit, but this didn't work either. Soon, I learned that although I'm able to bring people around to whatever degree, I still have an invisible shield down-within that never ceases to fail at self-sabotaging. If I'm ever able to even initiate a conversation with anyone, (nearly every time I wait to be spoken to regardless of how confident I am to say something first to anyone I find appealing) most of these people become opportunistic and try to simply use me in such obvious ways as if I'm too blind to notice, others in a more conniving manner (but I still recognized in the midst), and those that were genuine were still harmed by own suspicions. I simply can't seem to solve this issue even if it's handed to me on a silver platter, which has been done many times, but I always aim it right into the trash-can. I've lost just about every single person from this invisible wall that I've learned to build in my life and even those small few that have managed to stick around, I can sniff the resentment they hold within one way or another, but they're tolerating my ass for something, right? Throughout all of this, I've slowly learned to become heavily dependent on marijuana and on/off with cigarettes, which has now slowly led to moderate/heavy \"ski\" usage depending on the day or activity. My health is slowly deteriorating, my weight is dropping slowly to amounts I haven't seen in over a decade, my mind is cluttered with garbage disallowing me to continue with business or hobbies, and everything else that I have left is slowly diminishing away - all I can do is wallow in disgust and embarrassment towards myself. All that comes to mind is the quote from Tupac Shakur, \"Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive - never surrender.\" However, I've come to a point where I have no desire to even turn this around either, once again linking back to my weird obsession with thriving in misery. I don't want to indulge in this weird behavior any longer, but I can't help it - it's who I've programmed myself to be and if I don't act this way, then I can't identify with who I am after all these years of what made me who I became - so if do change, then who am I? Still unrecognizable to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only conclusion I've came to is that I'm destined to slowly fade away and embrace and accept all the harm that is slowly nicking away at my armor. When you know something instinctually, you just know it's right - you don't know how though. This is exactly how I'm feeling at this point and the feeling hasn't gone away for quite sometime now (several years). I've never been diagnosed with anything, I'm pretty much a golden-human of sorts with the meaning that I have no mental, health, or physical issues. I've never bothered to see a therapist or psychologist or anything of the sort - I know it won't help and I won't take any medications either, I'm not that type of person. I'm not posting this as a sort of plea/last-call/advice seeking/self-pity or anything, only as a daring-act of some sort from an extremely reserved and self-conscious person and could only imagine to expose my deepest, inner thoughts and feelings while receiving some sort of gratification doing so (something like joining the mile-high club, lol). I feel that since my days truly are numbered and I am on a slow-downward spiral towards the inevitable, I may as well expose the whats truly inside in a way that I don't have to be ashamed at being linked towards - a weird bucket-list task of some sort. No one in my real-life knows this side of me, even though many have their suspicions and have tried to hint that they recognize what's going on, but I'll never provide them with the confirmation they're searching for due to the invisible wall I've built. Due to my \"perfectionist\" nature, I've become excellent at hiding things from others whenever and however I please; so great that those whom try to genuinely help without bringing attention to it eventually give-up and even if I try to help myself, I couldn't turn it off no matter how I try. I've come to a point where it almost seems as if though everyone wants me, but I don't want myself and if I feel useless from within, how can I find usefulness in anything else? It's mental torture just attempting to hang on for another day to see if things change, yet I'm not brave enough to put a sudden end to it all for one reason or another, therefore my only conclusion is to keep myself dazed as much as possible until the final string remains where I can easily snap away then.",

I've never had any close friends, I'm so lonely. I try to reach out but I'm so socially awkward (social anxiety &amp; aspergers). I dropped out of hs because of mental Heath, trying to get my GED but I have a math learning disorder and I gotta get paperwork etc. I've attempted suicide twice and almost died, I just feel like I should of never been born. I'm honestly a mistake. This was supposed to be the best time of my life, and every year I'm getting older and losing my youth and opportunities for these experiences.

But it's not how the things are.\n\nI am studying degree course which I thought I will be happy about and good at it. And it turns out that it is very hard and struggling through each day is hell for me. I have to force myself to attend lectures. What is more, most of the time I don't have anyone to sit with. I sit alone in one of the front rows, and I try to focus on the topic but inside, I feel sad that I don't have my group of people to talk and sit with.\n\nI am arguing a lot with my father and I think it really makes things worse. We don't agree nearly about anything and he is often shouting at me and he thinks that he knows everything the best. He doesn't want to listen to anyone and through the years he made that we hardly ever meet the rest of the family, which we used to do earlier.\n\nMy family doesn't support me. When I start to talk about my problems, they don't want to listen to me or they say that I'm exaggerating. But I don't feel that way. I think I really have a problem and I even set a visit with a therapist, but I have to wait for it about two weeks from now.\n\nI feel like I have to force myself to do anything. I don't enjoy reading books, watching movies and riding a bike like I used to do before. Even the nice weather doesn't make me happy and motivated. I feel like the best thing that can happen to me is to go to sleep and never wake up again. I don't want to live that way.\n\nI can feel days passing so fast and every day is making me closer to death. Everyone is getting older and a few weeks ago I have lost my grandmother which made things even worse. My mother is suffering from depression and after that incident she was crying about a week without a break.\n\nI have lost nearly all my social contacts which I used to have. Now I only keep in touch with one person, my best friend, and I'm really happy to have him. But I don't see him on daily basis, so in school I'm alone most of the time.\n\nI feel like crying often than even before. I feel that I'm hopeless and things aren't gonna improve even a bit. I don't see the point of this whole life and sometimes I feel like I really want to end it all.\n\nYesterday I had something like panic attack. I couldn't sleep, I was crying and like shaking inside. I had to take sedative to calm myself, and after that I somehow managed to go to sleep. The thing like that have never happened to me earlier, so I don't know what to think about it.\n\nSorry for any mistakes, English is not my main language. I hope you guys understand what I was trying to tell you. Have a nice day.",

            "selftext": "Hello redditors! First time posting here, I need to share what's happening in my life. I'm on mobile so I apologize for formatting issues.\n\n\nIt started about three or four years ago, the last highschool years. As a socially anxious person I had few friends and never had a romantic relationship. I hated myself for not being able to communicate with others as easily as everyone else. I was always the awkward guy of the group. After I entered college, things got better for a while, my anxiety took a break and I was allowed to make new friends and even start a relationship with my SO. But then things got harder and harder.\n\n\nI study a STEM mayor and soon realized what kind of cutthroat college I was at. People are awful here, having no shame in stepping on others to stay ahead. I had a few problems with some peers and that threw my down the spiral again. My anxiety was back, my new confidence was gone, I even broke up with my SO. That was when I started with the alcohol. I'm a heavy drinker but I seldom do it, so I was comfortable for a while. Then things got worse. \n\n\nI developed terrible sleeping habits, I have zero motivation to get any work done. My personal space is a mess and I can't find the energy to fix it. I stoped cooking and instead started ordering fast food almost every day. When I actually cook it's something that requires low effort AKA not nutritional. When my confidence peaked I started going to the gym and even got into fencing but I threw all that away, so I got a lot fatter. I eat a lot of junk food, drink lots of soda, when I drink alcohol I drink like I mean it. I also had a porn addiction in high school that's currently making a comeback. \n\n\nThe breaking point and the reason I'm writing this is because I'm getting hooked on pot. I can't afford to lose any more motivation, I'm barely making it at college so I shouldn't start doing drugs, not even pot. I feel tired all the time and I'm afraid I'm doing something wrong with my body. I feel myself losing health, if that makes any sense. \n\n\nI'm afraid I will lose it completely any day, I need advice on breaking these habits and get back on track. If you have nothing to say, I still thank you for reading all of this. \n\nCheers and stay strong.",

Initially for a few years I didn\u2019t leave the house often due to illness, but by the time I had recovered physically, the anxiety/depression had spiralled so far out of control I have ended up keeping myself almost completely isolated for 15+ years. I have my family, my mum is the sole reason I\u2019m still here, if I didn\u2019t have her I would have ended it a long time ago. Apart from that though, I haven\u2019t had a friend or even a meaningful conversation with anyone for nearly 20 years. There were periods where I\u2019ve gone weeks/months without leaving the house.\n\nI\u2019ve sought help several times, seen therapists, tried anti-depressants but never really make any progress and time keeps going on. 4 years ago I gave it one last chance and opened up to a new dr, she referred me to the community mental health team who I saw\u2026 and then a week later got a letter in the post \u201cwe don\u2019t help people like you here\u201d. When you\u2019ve felt incredibly isolated/depressed/suicidal for most of your life getting a letter like that from the one team who are supposedly there to \u201csupport people who have complex or serious mental health problems\u201d is crushing. I\u2019m pretty sure for the last few years I\u2019ve suffered from derealization too, nothing feels real, and in general I have just completely given up on life.\n\nI\u2019ve tried getting out, volunteering, etc. but the more I\u2019m around people the more lonely I feel. I long for deep connections with people, but I\u2019m so socially and mentally messed up nothing really evolves beyond the basic meaningless day-to-day interactions strangers have. I feel my mind slipping away, unexplained physical symptoms, basic cognitive abilities declining, paranoia, and I don\u2019t know how much more I can take.\n\nHonestly, I just don\u2019t know what to do, I feel like there's no way back from this, any ideas?",

As time passed by I don't know why I just couldn't concentrate in class, even though I tried to study I would get distracted and started struggling very hard academically. I did manage to get all my credits for the semester but my grades aren't that good while my friends scored 85-90 I just scored 60-70. I also struggled to make friends meaning I am lonely and have no one to talk to. I have become so lonely that being in a large circle of people makes me extremely uncomfortable.  \nWhenever I am a bit happy or something or feeling positive I remember how badly I am struggling academically and socially and get depressed and sad. I have come to a point where I want to end it all but my thinking about my parents is what stops me from taking the step. At this point, I have had enough and don't know what should I do. So here I am if I can get some advice or to see a life from a new perspective",

Now, the thing that makes me sad is that I don\u2019t think I\u2019m living up to my full potential. This is the biggest factor in my possible depression. I am confident in my looks and personality but I have no drive to succeed in my social environment, even though I really, really want to. And it pisses me off. At school, I end up sitting quietly in solitude because I\u2019m scared and feel no motivation to socialize. Socializing with people doesn\u2019t make me nervous, I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it, if that makes any sense. Some nights I will stay up all night, sometimes crying because I\u2019m not able to do the things I want to do. It\u2019s like I have two personalities and the shitty one is the only one being expressed. Would this even be depression? What is causing me to feel like a dull loser even though I love myself at the same time? Lack of self confidence? I am confident though...at least I think. Fuck. If I wasn\u2019t depressed already, this sure as hell is going to make me depressed.",

Most of them suck lol, yes. Depression has a purpose: it's your Subconscious trying to tell you something, but because you've spent so long running from it / not listening to it, it's decided to grind everything to a halt because it doesn't know how else to get your attention. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- People who look happy, and even genuinely believe that they are, can be in a depression but are delusional about it and are blind to it, including ourselves. (Don't get that confused with thinking that happy people don't exist or that there is no way out.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- The opposite of Depression is Integration.

Every action, every thought, every helpful gesture, everyone and every thing you see.. passes through it and is distorted. The point is not that the lens is broken; its just time for new glasses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems to come on in one of two way: gradually, or suddenly. \n\nThat sounds asinine, I know, but I'll explain. It comes from either the gradual wearing down of being in a situation for too long, or suddenly after a life-changing event. Thankfully, the journey back to You is the same regardless. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHere are some actions you can choose to take:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Listen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot with your ears, not with your head. Feel like nothing you've been trying has been working? Stop doing the same shit. You can't 'think' your way out of this, and unfortunately intelligent people are prone to depression and hyper-rumination. I'm not spiritual or religious, but yeah: mindfulness is a skill that can help with this. Sounds too hokey? Enjoy your depression then lol\n\n\\[Side note: it's good to laugh at yourself and your situation. Find the frustration in still being stuck where you are, grit your teeth, and give a frustrated chuckle. Other people have been where you are and made it out.\\]\n\nMaybe it'll help if I explain the \"Listen\" thing a bit: \n\nThe brain works a certain way. Regardless of how we 'think' it works, be it a spiritual &amp; religious or scientific perspective, it operates in a way that doesn't need our opinion of it to function. Ph.D, Holy Scriptures, or LSD: a brain is a brain. Depression is an subconscious signal, and our brains are super-bad at multitasking. It can't really do two things at once and do them well, so it uses that as a way of blocking out pain. The more time you spend activating your language centre with internal dialogue, and thoughts, the less time you spend experiencing the painful emotions. Which is great!... if you never want to move forward.\n\nThis type of listening is a skill you don't have yet. If you did, you wouldn't be here! hahaha XD\n\nHere are some ways you can develop it, and I truly believe anyone can:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Go to counselling: \n\ncounselling is all about creating an environment in which you feel safe to explore and accept the past, and feel unconditional acceptance for your struggles, not \"there's something wrong with me\". If you don't feel that acceptance in a session, find a different counsellor and don't give up until you feel like \"this guy gets it.\" (....or...\"gal\"). Then don't hold anything back. Athletes go to a masseuse when they've got a knot in a muscle; counselling is just where you go when you've got a knot in the heart. It's going to be painful, but you'll feel the release if you push through it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Practice mindfulness / being present:\n\nuse apps, yoga, youtube, etc. Plenty of resources out there. The HeadSpace app is effing great. Basic place to start is sitting quietly and counting your breath as high as you can. When a distraction or thought comes in, don't berate yourself. Just notice it and resume counting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Read books on the topic:\n\nA paper one. Not an online forum, not an audio-book, not a Kindle. An ink-on-paper book. Why? Because sitting down to read is a habit-forming, calming, self-care ritual. The fact that the book has information about psychology and emotions is really just bonus points. You get to see physical progress as your bookmark slowly works it's way through the pages. When you're done, you can't deny that you're now in a place that is just a little bit different from where you were earlier. Then put it on an empty and do it again; the book case becomes a trophy case. I'd recommend \"Whole Again - by Jackson MacKenzie\" to anyone who's been through any kind of trauma; not just people who have been through traumatic relationships. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere \"Listening\" gets you and why it's important will come in a later step.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Listen\n2. Change Your Environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI debated making this number one, and honestly some part of me feels like it really should be. \n\n\\*Remove all things from your environment that inhibit your growth beyond this.\\*\n\nAnything that provokes a negative emotion, get rid of it. Doesn't have to be forever, but it sure as fuck does need to be right now. These things may not be obvious; some things may feel great at first when you engage them but then feel awful / shameful afterwards. Netflix binging, videogames, substances, and even certain people. Anything that is a distraction from how you are really feeling, and anything that negatively contributes to that state, needs to go. \n\nBTW... if at the words \"certain people\", a particular face comes time mind.... I'm going to validate you: Yes. Them. Exactly that person / persons. No matter how \"helpful or benevolent\" they may seem, they need to go. And you don't owe anyone an explanation for bettering your life. Handling depression means taking responsibility for your own emotional well being and handing back the responsibility others have dumped on you. Everyone needs to shoulder their own weight, and if someone's weighing you down and isn't keen on handling themselves, let them fall. They need to learn how to get themselves up again too.\n\nThe ONE thing I would recommend in relieving yourself of toxic people (even people who you feel love for)... is don't make a scene. Just calmly, politely, go. Because: you may say something you'll regret; \"anything you say can and will be used against you\" lol; and depending on your situation, it might be safest to just vanish. So long as you are seeking vengeance or justice for how this person has treated you or made you feel, then you're still playing their game, you're still engaging with them, and you're giving them what they want. The only way to win this tug-o-war is to drop the rope.\n\nLastly, I'd recommend putting away any sentimental items that remind you of the past or this person / persons. There'll come a time when these things and the memories attached to them won't impact you so heavily, but right now they're anchors in the past and they contribute to keeping you where you are. Boldly embrace the future for the exact reason that you don't know where it goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Listen\n2. Change Your Environment\n3. Build A Corner-Stone Habit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust one. Don't take a massive inventory of all the things you don't like and want to change, or list all the ways you think you could be better or more perfect than you are. This process is about accepting and embracing who / where you already are, and then launching off of that platform. Shame doesn't get you into the gym. \n\nThere's a reason this comes after \"Change Your Environment\" and not before. This is still about doing LESS. As little as possible. Not more. If we could all get past depression by becoming massive busy-bodies that run fortune 500 companies, bench 350lbs, and star in Hollywood blockbusters, then Robins Williams wouldn't have killed himself. \n\n....fuck I miss that guy.....\n\nHarsh truth, but there it is. It's entirely possible for \"progress\" to become the distraction that covers up how we're really feeling. It's not sustainable and when it comes crashing down it will be worse because now you've added more responsibilities to your life instead of taking responsibility for your emotional well being. It's okay. How to do that is not an obvious thing in our society, or at least I have never felt like it was explained well.\n\nAnyway, a Corner-Stone Habit is some thing you choose that is your ultimate mission. For 66 days straight, do not break the chain. If you do, forget it happened, and do it twice the following day. Mistakes will happen, but what ever you do, do not stop. The reason it's the corner-stone is that once it has been ingrained, you can chain other habits and changes you want to make in your life off of that foundation. 66 days. Again, I think paper is better than screen on this; have a calendar that you scratch off with a big red X and take pride in your progress, and forgive yourself when you stumble so you don't lose momentum.\n\nIn my opinion, these are the three most powerful corner stones:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Go to bed, and wake up, at exactly the same time every day.\n\n\\- Make your bed immediately after you wake.\n\n\\- Scratch out on paper, in a nightly-journal, one single thing that you're grateful for or appreciated about the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, that last one completely blows the other two out of the water. Like, if you lived on the frozen shores of Northern Canada and depression was a beautiful baby seal-cub, all doe-eyed in white fluff... that habit would be the club you mercilessly send it to its maker with. \n\nWhat it does is slowly shift that lens that I mentioned earlier. It is powerful, do not underestimate it or think it to be beneath you. Write down anything from \"I'm fuckin grateful for sundried-tomatoes\" to \"the unfathomable complexity, vastness, and beauty of the Universe itself\". \n\nWhile you're at it, ask yourself this question: \"What type of experience would I have had to go through in order to consider myself unbelievably lucky... yes... lucky... to be where I am right now?\" - Victor E. Frankl \n\nTake a walk through war history if you're having trouble finding an answer. The point isn't for you to feel shame about not appreciating what's around you, the point is for you to find the beauty in it. That's the new lens, the new set of glasses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Listen\n2. Change Your Environment\n3. Build A Corner-Stone Habbit\n4. Find The Beauty In Others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBunch of smart guys who paid a lot for their degrees did a 75 year long study on happiness at Harvard. 75 years. Literally longer than the Internet through which you are reading this has been around. \n\nLong story short: social connection, social bonds, and relationships are the keys to long-term health and happiness.\n\nThe catch 22 is that there is no possible way for you to connect with others without first connecting with yourself, which means experiencing fully, embracing and accepting.... your pain. That's why Listen is so important. That's why practising the skill of \"finding beauty, humour, and gratitude in everything\" is so important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's ironic, isn't it?\n\nThe key to a happy life is paying attention to, noticing, and contributing to the well being of others... but \n\nDepression forces you to focus entirely on your self and won't let go until you embrace yourself and your own pain or trauma fully. \n\nIt's the most cruel paradox..... but hey... life's funny lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal isn't to stop negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. The goal is to stop thinking so much about good and bad things entirely so you're not clouded from everything else that's going on around you. Like people who matter. But you need to go through the pain first, not around it or away from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI would \\*like\\* to say you'll know it when you get there, because your thinking will shift from \n\n\"I wonder if I came off too disconnected/shy/uncaring/sad/rude/awkward or weird with that person...\"\n\nto\n\n\"I wonder how that person is.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the truth is that you won't know it. It'll just be second nature until you have a day like this one where you suddenly pause and realise \"Oh shit! I beat depression a while ago and I didn't even notice!\"\n\nThen post about how you got there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers!",

She had a brain tumor the size of your fist. She survived. She's so different now. I can't remember the way she used to sound before she was attacked. The only thing that hasn't changed is that she still loves me.\n\nSo, yea, when I feel down sometimes, I call her. And she makes things so clear. You see, my mom and I are the same person. I know that as I'm typing, she's thinking of me. Earlier last night, I was almost ready to call her and BOOM the phone rang.\n\nWhen I told my mom about some of the mistakes I made with my ex-wife, she said \"oh, I did the same thing with your father.\" We're so connected now.

I've tried to commit suicide before, more than once, but I never succeeded. \n\nI met my girlfriend on May 19th last year, we quickly became friends, at the time I had a boyfriend, a really shitty one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up in a Christian home, so being gay or even bi was wrong. I broke up with my boyfriend because I realized I was in love with my girlfriend, who was my best friend at the time. My ex-boyfriend cheated on me more than once, but I didn't care. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her out, she had never been in love before, but she knew she loved me, the happiest day of my life. The week I met her, I was going to go through with hanging myself, she made me want to fight. She means the world to me. \n\nMy parents, on the other hand, wasn't so happy about it, but again, I couldn't give less of a fuck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are driving me insane, I'm never good enough for them, it doesn't matter what I do, I am not good enough.\n\nI sat down and talked to them about my suicidal thoughts, but not about my attempts.

Your god can't help me, I have only gotten worse and what has my parents done? Called me insane, a fat ass, a brat. \"Know I know why you don't have any friends.\" Thank you mother, that made me feel better.

I just feel like i\u2019m not doing enough. I\u2019m majoring in the sciences because I wanna go to med school and be doctor. However, I just feel like i\u2019m not doing anything too notable in this moment. I\u2019m a coordinator in this organization at school which helps students on campus to meet new people and do a lot of internal reflection/ participate in a vulnerable space at this retreat we have once a year. It\u2019s smaller sub events throughout the year but we pretty much work to make the retreat happen. This year it was extremely successful and it made me really happy. Its means a lot to me and I get paid for it. That\u2019s coming to an end tho because of a 2 year term as a coordinator. I\u2019m glad I met the people I did though, makes campus life more exciting \n\nother than that tho I don\u2019t work, I have a few hobbies, I exercise, typical shit. Idk if i\u2019m being harsh on myself or i\u2019m not doing enough. Not to compare but everyone around me is working jobs and are full time students. Not everyone but a decent majority. I\u2019m a full time student as well but I feel like I don\u2019t apply myself as far as getting internship positions or any further work experience besides like uber and stuff. Just makes me feel down sometimes. I hope everyone is doing okay, even if you aren\u2019t where you wanna be just always remember that you will get there.",

            "selftext": "I guess it\u2019s time for me to start typing. \n\nMy life is like....an unstable snowy mountain. You and your friends are just having fun, doing your thing. (This personifies me doing whatever I\u2019m doing).And then all of a sudden, Big Daddy Depression comes crashing down the mountain.\n\nWhen I say this. I mean, my life is very up and down. I\u2019m a rock and such for a lot of people, plus I have family that needs my help constantly. So. I\u2019ll just be chilling or whatever, and then I get hit with so much shit at once it makes me sick. People don\u2019t care about me or what I\u2019m doing at the time, they just need Anon\u2019s attention RIGHT. NOW. People need me to go to their homes and fix cars and such, carry heavy things around in my pick up truck; people I know online are breaking down on me with their depression and stuff(which I don\u2019t mind listening to) and people in both worlds demanding my attention right at that moment. Keep in mind that this is always at the same time.* I wish my life could either be all peaceful or all stressful, but I can\u2019t fucking handle this.\n\n\nAnd it really cuts me deep that nobody is willing to do the same for me...I just wish people appreciated me I guess. \n\nI revisited some thoughts recently. Personal things. My teacher in 7th grade, for a whole year, he. Sigh. He put out cigarettes on my arms and such after he did things to me in the restroom. It just reminds me how worthless I am to people, you know? And I\u2019ve been in relationships before with people that have used me for sex, so at this point I\u2019m just. Why bother? I have thoughts of saying fuck it and shooting myself in the head.\n\nBut. People need me I guess. I already have a plan. People have until December 31st 2023 to either mature, or get out of my life. On that day, I\u2019m ending it. My goal is to mature people and help them grow as much as I can before that point. Trying to make sure my parents will be able to retire, my younger cousins will grow to be strong men and women...all of my friends will be able to have lives for themselves and stop relying on me. At that point, nobody will need this piece of garbage I call Anon. \n\n\n\n\nTO THE POINT.\n\n\nWhat I do to either cull or null my depression is pretty simple.\n\n-Sit by a window. You may be like \u201cNope, world too ugly to see me. Tomorrow.\u201d, but nobody said the blinds have to be open. Sit in the ambient sunlight on your phone or something. It helps.\n\n-Binge an interesting show on Netflix or Hulu. OR, YouTube is free! Watch some gaming channels if you\u2019re into that. There\u2019s a LLOOOOOT of content on YouTube.\n\n-This may not apply to a lot of people, but for those it does: produce some music. It always helps me because it gives me something to do. Or if you\u2019re into art, just draw random fruits and vegetables. Every single one you can think of. It usually makes for some pretty funny results that will make you smile.\n\n-Browse r/funny or r/trashy or r/showerthoughts , they\u2019re funny subreddits that always make me smile.\n\nGuys. It\u2019s easy to let it consume you, I\u2019m no stranger. And I\u2019m guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess. But I hope you all have a good day today.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know. Just a vent.\n\n*990 notifications alone from one week. Week is 7 days. 198 messages a day excluding Monday and Tuesday. Just oof.",

            "selftext": "I have a shitty family. Not the kind to do drug or sell kids but the kind to talk shit about everything and everyone, the unsupportive kind wich doesn't help. I've come to the point where I don't care anymore about their opinions.  I just listen not te get kicked out of house but I don't listen anymore.\n\nI've also accepted the fact that I'm not going to be something amazing. Depression is a curse, it comes for no reason and fucks up every chances you have on being succesfull unless you get help. Depression has a cost and it's a safe futur for me. \n\nSome people manage to be succesfull with depression and 0 help and I'd like to congratulate these people. They have strong minds, but I'm certainly not one of them. I'm becoming more and more aware of what I am and started to accept it.\n\nAccepting what you are is really tricky, \n\nYou don't want to be overly optimistic or it'll cause more depression because you'll realize that you're not capable to reach your expectations or overly pesimistic or you'll underestimate yourself. What is also crucial and the reason you need to be isolated in the first place is that you MUST listen to ALL your complaints. If you're under your negative relatives influence you'll call them excuses. \n\nTHESE ARE NOT EXCUSES, at least not for your brain. Your brain is convinced that those complaints are real and That's the only thing that matters. \n\nThese are complaints that comes from your reality, so whatever they're, no matter how Silly they look, you must listen to them.\n\nThen you must confront them to your past experiences. One of my complaints adressed by my teachers regarding my bad grades was that I was lazy.\nWherease I work out 6 day a week every weeks, I practice music 1 hour a day. I also love drawing and could spend a day doing drawing. So past experiences has shown that I'm not THAT lazy. \n\nSo why can't I study ?\nIs it because I have Bad environnement ?\nIs it because I hate finance ?\n\nNo mattter what the answers or questions are, you must defend yourself from them and keep doing it untill you're convinced that the answers to your questions are the true reasons of you're acting.\n\n\nThe truth is that ONLY YOU can understand yourself. No one except a therapist or yourself will ever try understanding the underlying reasons of your behaviour. You must discover them.\n\nYou are REALLY not as Bad as you think you are. In my experience, depressed people I met and myself are usually people who're trying to do what they think is the right thing even if it cost them to accept facts that are contrary to their beliefs, contrary to their nature.\n\nThis is more than ANYONE Can Do, most people when facing truth opposite to their current belief will reject them, but depressed people accept them because they know it's the right thing to do and try to change their system of belief accordingly to be as fair as possible. \n\nThis pushed to the extreme Can be overwhelming.  Indeed, how would you react if someone told you that everything you believe, everything you desire is false and wrong and you know 100% that this person is telling the truth ?\n\n\nMost people will refuse to hear it, \nbut those who would accept it are people who're trying to do the right thing. These people are those who are depressed.",

            "selftext": "A little backstory, I have suffered from depression for years, dating back to middle school. In October 2018, I had my first panic attack and was diagnosed with GAD. I've been taking medicine for it since but I still haven't felt the same since my first panic attack. It's been a scary few months because my panic attacks make me feel like I'm having a heart attack and even with medicine, my anxiety attacks persisted and the gear of having a heart attack and dying became my new norm. The mental toll of feeling like you were dying everyday made me feel as if suicide was a better option than living with this anxiety disorder. I've had suicidal thoughts almost every day since then until today. \n\nI had a great day. Co workers were nice to me and appreciative of some of the work I've been doing recently. I had a great lunch and after work, had a great date night with my girlfriend. Not once did I have a panic attack or thought of depression. It was nice just living in the moment. I know tomorrow I'll probably go back to being an anxious and depressed mess but it was just nice to have a reprieve from that.\n\nI just wanted to type this out so I can reflect on it when I'm feeling down and maybe help someone else see that sometimes there are days that make it feel like this life is worth living",

It's just no end in sight. Right now I work part time and go to school but for what? Money is nice obviously but school is, I feel like I'm really only going to school because it's expected of me. I used to have dreams and aspirations for what I wanted to do in the future but all of them, literally all of them, have come crashing down. Everything is pointless when every hobby, interest, and area of joy that I used to experience has completely gone away. I will literally try doing those things, like video games or writing, and I'll just feel nothing inside, absolute boredom and fatigue. I used to employ maladaptive daydreaming as well, so that I could imagine myself in like a video game universe or something, anything to escape from the particularly dreadful days in the real world. But guess what now that's gone too. I don't know if it's ADHD or effexor doing that to me, but it's like now my brain is a useless hunk of pink meat. So almost without exception- on any given day there is nothing for me to live for, at all.\n\nLately I've been feeling very lonely as well but I doubt that 1) anyone would ever take serious interest in me and 2) that having a partner would even help with the gaping hole in my soul or finally restore some of my contentment with life. \n\nI'm not suicidal at the moment but I wouldn't mind dying. This is all bullshit and I just want to stop hurting.",

My favorite cousin, the person I looked up to as a kid, told me he thought I didn't hang out with him because I hated him.\n\nMy brother probably thinks I'm the same way. I haven't celebrated a birthday with him since he turned 18. This year, he went to the casino with his wife. I couldn't even get a hold of him. So you know what I did? I cornered him at work. I brought him a sweater that said \"Legends Never Die\" and Celtics socks, even though I hate the Celtics and took it to him where he was working as a server. I'm a terrible brother.\n\nI just woke up from a wet dream, thinking of a random girl from my past. She probably doesn't know I exist, but in the dream she wanted me.

I want to be successful in life, have a family in the future, and go to college. But because of my draining depression, I feel as if these goals are completely out of reach because of my beyond poor grades and my sometimes shitty on and off personality has destroyed many of my most cherished friendships.\n\nI have lost much interest in life as well. It feels completely bland and I can't remember the last time I have had any positive form of emotion. Waking up is completely draining, and I hate to admit that I break down at the thought of just arriving at school.\n\nI feel like I am a burden on my \"friends\" (who even have the audacity to talk shit straight to my face as well as behind my back) and have been contemplating suicide. I've avoided it because I hope that when I grow older, I can look back and thank myself for not making a poor choice.\n\nSome people might say \"Buddy, you need to get new friends\". If I tried to get new friends, I'd get no friends because I am too drained to try. I feel that if I cut them off, I would feel more alone than I have ever felt before, which terrifies me.\n\nMaybe I will end it, maybe I won't, let's just see if it gets any better.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve dealt with depression and anxiety for practically my whole life. I always felt being depressed or anxious was the default mode everyone was in. That going through the motions of what society expected was normal. My depression, like for many, was extremely rough in my teen years. I had moments of feeling extremely suicidal, but one person always kept me sane.\n\nMy cat Rascal.\n\nMy dad brought him home about a few months after my mom left him in a rough divorce that left me rather traumatized and emotionally scarred. I latched onto Rascal and he quickly became my best friend. Any time I was upset, he knew. He would come to me and meow constantly until I hugged it out with him. He was the best damn emotional support animal I could ever ask for. Once I turned around 20 I finally sought treatment for my depression and anxiety, getting an official diagnosis from my doctor and finding the right regiment. Rascal was at my side through everything. I was happy for once in my life. Things were looking great. I actually started brushing my teeth regularly, brushing my hair, eating better, exercising, the whole nine yards. I felt I could actually live my life and chase my dreams. That all changed this last December.\n\nI came home from work late at night, about 1am or so, to find Rascal collapsed on the ground in a mess of his own urine. I panicked. Hard. Rascal had just turned 15 the month prior, so I knew it was only a matter of time. After a day of emergency care from a vet, he was diagnosed with an extremely rare adrenal gland tumor that was more than likely malignant cancer. We had the chance of surgery that he could die from or euthanasia. My whole family was distraught. As much as I wanted the surgery, we all knew euthanasia was the right choice. He was buried in the back yard that day by my crying dad (someone I\u2019ve never seen cry like that before). The loss of Rascal was timed horribly as my grandma also had to be put in a nursing home. December always has a way of fucking my family.\n\nI still feel like Rascal is here in the house and I just can\u2019t find him. Like he\u2019s just going to be laying in one of his favorite spots or he\u2019s gonna come running into my room when I call for bedtime. I still catch myself singing the song I\u2019d sing to him when I was just a little upset. Ever since he died, I\u2019ve regressed so hard. I don\u2019t enjoy my job anymore. When the days were rough, I\u2019d always think \u201cat least I get to come home to Rascal\u201d. I don\u2019t brush my hair anymore, and with as long as it is, it gets tangled easily. Luckily I still brush my teeth, though nowhere near as regularly as I should. I know I\u2019m sipping hard into depression again and I don\u2019t know what to do or who to turn to. I have plenty of friends, but none of the care I get from them or anyone else feels genuine. I don\u2019t enjoy my hobbies anymore in the slightest, so when I am home from work I feel miserable while forcing myself to either play a game or draw. My other cat tries to help, but I know my sister is going to take her when she moves, so I feel like I can\u2019t get close to her if she\u2019s just gonna leave.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. I have literally no coping mechanism outside of \u201cignore it\u201d. Rascal helped me cope in ways I never could fully appreciate until he was gone. I want to have another cat that I can pamper just like I did for Rascal, but I still can\u2019t get over the guilt of what had happened to him. What kind of coping can I possibly do at this point? I\u2019ve faced the pain of losing my best friend for months now and I just don\u2019t know how I can resolve my grief. I do fine for weeks, then I have a dream about Rascal and the wound is ripped open again. I know grieving is a long and painful process, but I don\u2019t know how to be happy anymore. Is it time to change my medicine or is it just my lack of coping skills to blame?\n\nI could just really use the advice, Reddit",

            "selftext": "High school was the time that I couldn't really maintain relationships. I had friends that come and go but there was a specific group that really impacted me. \nI once considered these two people like close friends, and honestly at one point thought our friendship would last until adulthood. \nWhat made me reconsider was our differences. It was clear that I had different values regarding religion and other social issues but I didn't feel like that would ruin our friendship. \nAt this point, I'm still unsure what ended this friendship we once had. I said my goodbye in the most confusing manner, without any closure. I heard that I was acting like a confusing shithead from others and they're not wrong. I wasn't clear about why I left the friendship. \nTo be frank, I was never really honest. \nI had personal issues with both of them, and at times I caught myself venting to each of them about each other. It was a cycle of shit-talking as I would constantly criticize both of them. I would constantly say \" I can trust her.\" or \"I can't stand her attitude.\" I felt guilty. I've been backstabbing them both. It was a confusing mess and I still can't explain the situation clearly. \nBecause of this, I started to believe that I don't deserve their friendship, I will never get through to them; I will never be able to tell them how I truly feel. That's why it was unfortunate that It had to end.\nToday, they're probably living their lives, building new friendships and experiencing new things. \nMaybe the friend with the \"attitude\" feels bitter about me and wants to forget me, and I totally understand that. If she wants me out of her life, I'll accept that. \nAnd to the friend that I couldn't fully trust. I'm sorry. I'm a hypocrite, for I should not be trusted too. I care about you and I want the best for you. I wish I could be more sincere, and I wish I could be there for you. \nWe all went through some shit and that's what brought us together; I can't disregard that. I won't forget the good memories and I really do miss them. \n\nI can't accept the fact that we're not friends anymore.",

Everytime I think about him, My world just stops, and I can't feel anything around me, I don't feel like my skin is there, i don't feel Alive. Like i'm floating, i don't know what it is but it's really scary. Then I get scary thoughts, Like wanting to peel my skin off, or just hurt him. I'm 19 years old, i shouldn't be acting like this, i should be living my life. I was and then he left me and now i don't know what to do. I know no one will ever love me, after what he did, there's no way someone could genuinely love me. I'm just a big joke. I just really want to die. :(",

The best fuckin thing I have to  look to, the best line of logic, is that I'm not a fucking crack head, or haven't you know, been a hard drug or alcohol abuse for years on end. Even still, with what I fuckin did, I probably shouldn't have fucking done it.

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve never posted in here before due to my social anxiety, it\u2019s extremely hard to make a public post and being seen by a big number of people (even though is not that big), I\u2019m 19 years old, I\u2019ve been having mental health issues for 10 years now. I decided to make this post as my last resource to find somebody to talk to and get advice, I think that in here I can find someone who can understand how I feel, because everybody who I\u2019ve talked about it, they always make it seem like I\u2019m feeling depressed and self harm because I want to do it and I want to call up attention, they make me feel stupid and selfish, like if I\u2019m very wrong for being like this, and I constantly say that if I could decide, I would\u2019ve never been depressed like I am, I don\u2019t enjoy depression, I feel like I\u2019m in a mental hole I can\u2019t get in and gets more suffocating every time...\nI\u2019m a senior in High School because when I moved here when I was 17 years old, I was in my last year of school, but then in the school here they made me start over from 9th grade because my credits were not enough to be a senior. Now I\u2019m a senior with 19 years old and just that is enough to bring me down and eradicate all hopes and motivations I had for graduating and going to school, sometimes I don\u2019t go because I don\u2019t like the people there is very overwhelming for me because I get very anxious and I\u2019m extremely weird in social interactions, I haven\u2019t made any friends since I got here, with an exception of a girlfriend I recently break up with, I pushed her away because I was too depressed and my negativity was affecting her and our relationship so I decided to take space for myself but now I understand it\u2019s not the best for me and deeply regret it, she doesn\u2019t really understand depression or my OCD, I put myself down all the time, I can\u2019t stop mentioning how useless and unworthy I am, my mind gets flooded with suicidal thoughts and sometimes I can\u2019t even recognize myself in the mirror, I feel so disgusted with myself and how I look, sometimes I even try to puke everything I eat or skip meals, all that hurts the people that care about me, and that also affects me because I never mean to hurt someone else, I only mean to hurt and insult myself. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of absences in school because I isolate myself from everyone and everything, I have to go to 23 Saturday school and there\u2019s only 3 left, that much absences I have. I feel awful every time I don\u2019t go to school because I feel bad or just oversleep because I go to sleep late, I never talk about how I feel or what\u2019s going on with me. Also I\u2019m very boring, I\u2019m quiet and way too serious about everything, I hardly laugh at things and I don\u2019t like typical things that other people likes, roller coasters for example, a lot of \u201cfun\u201d things that I don\u2019t lime and I feel pushed away because of that, and it\u2019s true, who would like a party pooper who can\u2019t enjoy life and it\u2019s depressed putting itself down all the time? Well, that\u2019s me, I\u2019m pretty pathetic and stupid.\nAnd don\u2019t take me wrong, I love learning, science and math, I had dreams of working solving math problems or researching physics mysteries like quantum mechanics or astronomy, I would love to go to college and learn about all that stuff, but my high school situation always kills those dreams and I feel so pressured by it I can\u2019t handle it... Posting this it\u2019s extremely hard for me, I\u2019ve tried to write this 5 times already, I feel to shy and insecure to post this, for some reason I\u2019m scared I will be judged or just make a ridicule.\nAt this point I just want to talk to someone who can understand how I feel or have an idea about it and not blame me for it and make it seem like I\u2019m in this position because I want to or I want to call up for attention... I\u2019ve pointed a gun to my head a couple times already, I might some day actually pull the trigger, I hate myself way too much, I feel lost.\nI\u2019m sorry for writing a lot, I guess I needed to say it, probably this won\u2019t be read by anyone.\nAlso I apologize if my English is bad or very basic, my first language is Spanish and I\u2019m yet learning English.

I was bullied throughout all my years at school and ended up dropping out my sophomore year at high school.  I sunk my head into video games to compensate for my lack of social life.  My dad died when I was young, I got into fights with my mother a lot until it hit a breaking point and I moved out at 17.  When I turned 18, I inherited a lot of money from my father.  I blew it all in one summer, on fake friends that ended up leaving me once I was broke again.  I got into hardcore drugs and almost threw my whole life away. I slowly got back on track and over the last few years I've been able go maintain a steady job, but the lack of connection with other people has been hurting a lot recently.  Tonight I feel like I hit a breaking point, I'm starting to realize just how dead I feel on the inside.  I know I shouldn't feel this way but the lack of connection with other people and regrets that I have from my past are really starting to get to me.\n\nTl;dr I had a messed up past, struggled to get to a good spot but lack of emotional connection with others and feeling like I'm constantly alone is starting to get to me",

            "selftext": "I've been homeschooled my whole life. And I have 3 good friends, one is my best friend. Well they're all moving on. One is choosing to live in Nebraska(for some reason), one is going into the army, and the other is just drifting away. Ive never really had the chance to make more friends because of me being home most of my life. I graduated last year, and I've been stuck in this routine, everyday, wake up, go to work, come home and go to bed. I hate my job, and the people I work with. Ive tried moving out on multiple occasions, but every time the people Im supposed to be rooming with, back out. So I'm stuck here with my super religious dad, who is really hurtful all the time. He always comes and begs me to forgive him after he's blown up, And I say what he wants to hear \"Its okay dad, everyone has moments\" \"Don't worry about it, I don't even care\" which I do. but if I told him he'd want an explanation, and I dont wanna start WWIII in my house. Cause I don't agree with all of his beliefs to say the least. Most of what upsets me about him is his crazy beliefs (most of which aren't biblical, just his preferences) But I'm in his house so I respect him, and abide. Anyway, I'm just tired of it all, and I have no one to tell this too anymore. I used to tell my mom all this but she got sick, and my grandma had a botched surgery so they had to move in, and she's busy with that. I really don't want to add a \"depressed son\" to her plate of bullshit she has to juggle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have big ideas, I want to make films, TV shows. I have ideas, and half written scripts. I have Ideas of doing comedy. I've made a couple YouTube videos, and even started a podcast. But. Lately I've just lost all aspiration, I have no drive, I don't wanna do anything. Mostly because most of everything in my life fails, my relationships, my friendships.\n\n I have a really unhealthy way of dealing things now, I don't know how it started. But it did. My new unhealthy way of thinking is if I never do it, I'll never fail, I'll never get rejected, I'll never get hurt. So I just don't. I don't make videos anymore, I put off the podcast( I mean the co host is leaving anyway) I never applied for colleges, I never ask anyone out.\n\n So I'm here. Stuck. In a forever loop of going to work at a job I hate, and coming home to a dysfunctional family that could snap at any moment. I don't have anyone to \"grab a beer after work\" with or just talk too. I used to. not anymore. \n\nI just wanna get out of this loop, I do want too. I just don't have any willpower. I know I'm being a pussy, and I should just power through it, and it'll get better later. And I used to tell myself that. but lately that motivational voice has stopped talking to me. \n\n I Just don't wanna do anything anymore. I don't wanna live, but I don't wanna kill myself. I just want a person I can talk too. \n\nI want to have a relationship with my father, I want to have a conversation with him without him saying I'm a sinner, or lecturing me about how what I wanna do isn't biblically correct, I  just want him to say \" good job son\". I want to have a group of friends to hang out with, and come up with crazy ideas, and joke around with. I wish I had the motivation to get shit done. and friends to talk too. But they're all on to better things, and I'm still here. being a pos. bitching to the internet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes I know, others lives are a lot worse then mine, I get that. But I just wanted tell someone this. \n\nSo thanks for listening, even if no one is lol. yelling into a pillow is still therapeutic.",

It's not just that I feel hopeless, it's not just that I don't want to be alive its that I hate **existing** at all. I hate opening my eyes in the morning and hope I don't wake up when I sleep every night. I don't want the bad or the good. I just want it to stop. I'm overstimulated and beyond all my feelings of depression and self-loathing, I'm so fucking tired. I'm beyond tired, beyond fatigue, beyond exhaustion, I feel like I could give up any moment. I could just lie down on the ground and stay there until I either starve or die from not drinking water. I often fantasize about the idea of someone forcing me to choose between life or death in scenarios like a mugging or being confronted, \"your wallet or your life, you choose.\" The thought makes me feel so strange because I truly would face no fear in saying I would rather them take my life. I won't give one more inch to the world voluntarily I won't let it take anymore unless it takes it all. I don't want the good or the bad. I don't. I just want it to be over once and for all. I'm tired and I hate it all. I hate myself, I hate the world I was born into, but more than anything I hate the fact that existence was thrust onto me without consent in the first place. Nobody asks for this. Nobody.",

            "selftext": "So, I'm a 14 year old guy, I'm not going to say I'm depressed because at this point I don't even know. I just need to vent I guess. My day starts out with me simply rolling out of bed, already dressed because I couldn't be bothered to get undressed last night. I go to school, and I put up a facade. I don't act the way I want to act, I don't do the things I'd do. All I do is worry, I worry about how I'm going to act, what I'm going to say, and how. I hate it, I force myself to be an outgoing person when inside I cringe at the thought of leaving my room.  I hate what I am, and I hate myself for being sad after all I have. I look at the mirror and I hate what looks back, I always think of suicide, but I'm too much of a pussy to even do anything, and that makes me hate myself more.   \n\n\nI grew up in a house with an abusive father, he would beat and spit on my mother, but would never touch me. Back in elementary school, I had no friends, and the children saw that I was hurting, they would pretend to like me, just to stab me in the back. My father had to leave and I didn't get to see him for \\~3 years. Me and my mother left him and went to live in a homeless shelter, and after that we moved to a small town, in which i found my only real friend. My mother eventually fell into a drug addiction, which tormented me for years, she was the only person who I felt loved by, and it killed me to see her downward spiral. I would wonder what she would do when I turned 18 and started my life. That question daunted me. Around 2 years ago, my mother and I moved in with my grandparents and it was looking up, I had thought everything was fine. My mother left me at my grandparents and 'went out with some friends'. She didn't come home that night. She had attempted suicide via OD. I felt terrible, like I had done something wrong, like I had said something that finally set her over the edge. She lived and as far as I could tell, as 'fine' as you can be after that.  \n\n\nWe moved away, back into the big city, where I had to leave my only friend with not a day to say goodbye. During all this time, my father was in recovery, getting the help he needed, and I guess it was my mother's turn. I now live with my dad and I should be ecstatic, but I feel so confused and so scared. My dad has a girlfriend, and she has a daughter. I never leave my room unless I have an appointment or school. I see a counselor but all that does is make me feel guilty for not having anything to say.  \n\n\nI don't like to talk about how I feel, but I just got done crying and beating my arms until the pain outweighed my grief.   I'm sorry for the bad formatting and grammar, I've never been the best at that. I don't really use reddit, I just needed to get this off my chest.",

But anyways here's how if been feeling...\n\nI guess I've been struggling with depression for a long ass time now and I've never really confronted it until maybe the last year. Everything in my life is going really well. Promotion at work, engaged, new puppy, finally own my own home, great family relationship, but I still feel aweful. It's not normal to think about suicide as often as I do. I would never act on it, but that thought is still in the back of my mind. I've noticed that I have been relying more and more on alcohol to numb my senses and emotions but it's not really helping anymore. I need professional help and I don't know where to start. I  blessed to know what I'm going through and gifted with the strength to keep on without... You know... But I feel lost. What do I do?",

I asked her not to be negative and tell me divorce rates when I mention wedding planning, but apparently that\u2019s dumping on her. She literally told me fuck you wedding and I don\u2019t give two shits about you or your wedding. Why? Because she found out her 18 year old son was smoking weed and having sex. So what? What 18 year old doesn\u2019t do that? And I\u2019m didn\u2019t even dismiss those issues because she\u2019s going through other stuff.

Yeah like I\u2019ll be sad we didn\u2019t have a relationship because she constantly tormented me as a kid and still treats me like shit as an adult. \n\nMy best friend said my family is so fucked I\u2019m she thinks I need to talk to someone before I explode.

I woke up today and my whole body was aching. \n\nI told this to my father , to which he said ,\" Its just like you to fall from the stairs\" . I didn't react to it and said that my whole body ached. He shrugged it off completely and told me to go take a painkiller, in a very cold voice. He didn't even bother to look at me. For me , this was nothing out of the ordinary, or unexpected even. My parents have always been very cold to me. Probably because my elder brother outdid me at everything. Its not like I am bad or anything, but If I scored 90 on a test, my brother would score a 95. Anyways ,two days ago, my brother slipped on a wet floor and hurt his back a little. It wasn't even that serious. But they were so concerned. They were literally panicking. Its safe to say they don't care about me all that much.\n\nEven though this was nothing new to me , the sheer coldness of his voice hurt me. I reminded me of just how alone I am. No friends , no (real) family. Just me and my desolate soul. \n\nIts not even been 15 mins since that interaction with my father, but most of the pain has already faded away. No, its still there but I cant feel it like before. Its like a greater agony has come, which overwhelms that pain.",

I was just too depressed to do anything about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately I've been having negative thoughts about the whole ordeal again, and today while I was driving home from work I just said \"fuck it\" out loud in my car. I got a Monster from the 7/11 and went to town. Should I have sold her stuff for money instead? Yeah, but it would've taken too long. And I didn't want to inconvenience Goodwill with the amount of shit she left behind either. So I just threw it all away, and gave away select items that my friends were interested in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt feels really good so far.

All my close friends are hanging out and having fun without me and I want to ask them why because it pains me that they didn't invite me but I can't do anything because I would feel like such a burden if I asked. Maybe that's why they don't want to hang out with me. I don't know.\n\nI'm having a mental breakdown because there's not a single person who I can talk to without feeling as if I am burdening them. It sounds ridiculous to me but I've been staring at the facetime app for 20 minutes as if I'll make some revelation or something and discover someone to talk to and I'm just filled with so much pain.\n\nThis has been the worst time of my life and I'm letting all the adults and friends I have down whether I try or not. I want to talk to my friends about my pain but I can't even pick up my phone to text them without feeling like an asshole. Then, they hang out without me and it's like all my suspicions are proven true. How can I get out of this vicious cycle, it's eating me up and I don't know how much longer I can handle it. I just want to be able to live with myself and be happier again.\n\nI feel like I'm digging my own grave for my mental health, and I don't know how to fix it. I need help, please.",

            "selftext": "So I have had depression for a while, I have a lot of reasons on why I\u2019m depressed but I don\u2019t really wanna talk about personal information. I hate my fucking school, it\u2019s a small school with like 100 students and in my class theirs 21 students, a lot of them joke about having depression saying uh I\u2019m sad, I have depression and then start making jokes about suicide, yes, I don\u2019t know their whole personal life but usually, you don\u2019t just start talking to random students making jokes about being sad and depressed, like they don\u2019t even act depressed during school and it\u2019s most of are day, they are happy, having fun and laughing with their friends instead of being sad in the corner feeling worthless. depression and just being sad is what most people this generation think are the same, they are not at all, yes being sad is a part of it, my family doesnt care, friends don\u2019t even care about me and always make fun of me, I\u2019ve been bullied for years and still am. Enough about my personal life, my point is are generation should understand depression better and not just think it\u2019s a joke and it doesn\u2019t matter. Plus, faking depression is not ok at all, so stop if you\u2019re one of those people like those students at my school. Sometimes people also say to me that my face gives them depression, first of all that\u2019s bullying, second of all, stuff like that can start causing depression. Thank you for reading, plus if I can ask, do any of you know tips on how I can calm myself when I get super angry and sad, cause my depression is getting worse everyday but nobody is helping with it and I don\u2019t wanna talk to a therapist about my problems when I don\u2019t even trust my family with my problems, a lot of my problems are with my family anyway. thank you, hopefully you guys have a great day or night.",

All my life I\u2019ve seen death. Every single year since 5th grade there\u2019s been a funeral. 2018 was horrible there was 6 of them before summer was over. I see family fading away. Friends fading away. A lot of my family are dead to me. And now I have a crazy uncle that\u2019s beating his wife? Like WTF. He\u2019s in jail and now everyone is scared at home because he\u2019s out now and they think he\u2019s going to assault my house. \n\nThe love of my life broke up with me via text.\n\nI was shot twice. All i do is lay in bed all day now. I don\u2019t even want to get out of bed somedays.\n\nNo one in my life showed me any love. None of my family. I thought I felt love with my Ex, but it was obviously one sided. \n\nI don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about my feelings because I\u2019m the \u201crock\u201d. I\u2019m the guy that listens to everyone else. My friend group is very different than I am. My family is full of grown men who still act like they are in highschool. It\u2019s 2019 stop gangbanging. I was the first male in my family to graduate highschool. I attempted college, but I couldn\u2019t handle it. I was running out of fuel really quick working two jobs, school, and keeping my social life. I know it\u2019s doable.. but I just wasn\u2019t strong enough for it I guess.\n\nIn this lifetime I\u2019m alone. All I wish for is my family to be taken care of. If I didn\u2019t have people that I loved I might\u2019ve ended it way sooner. \n\nIf there is a higher being out there I just hope they are caring for others who are in darker situations than me. Sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t fight back and let that guy that shot me end it for good. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take this, but the sun always comes after the rain right?",

Suddenly, after a lifetime of wanting desperately to be a mother and aching over my infertility, I decided I don\u2019t think I want kids at all.  Just out of the blue, no rhyme or reason.  I assumed I was just going through a phase and waited it out, and it\u2019s only gotten stronger.  Images that used to fill me with rage and jealousy now fill me with repulsion.  I cringe at my ovulation testing supplies, I avert my eyes from photos of babies, and I recoil at the idea of having a kid living with me for 18 years.  There is fear and anxiety but it\u2019s unfocused.\n\nI wish that was all, but it\u2019s spread.  Marriages may have their ups and downs, but my husband feels more like a roommate to me now.  We barely spend any time together, and I don\u2019t think either of us really wants to.  I don\u2019t find him attractive.  But I don\u2019t find *anyone* attractive.  I figured it would be one thing to stop feeling for my husband and start desiring something else but all I want is to just be alone.  I would be perfectly satisfied to sit alone in my apartment, day in, day out, only leaving for work.  I would play my video games and write my fan fiction and I wouldn\u2019t need human interaction at all, and that would be just fine.\n\nWhat the hell happened to me?  I\u2019m really scared about these sudden drastic personality changes and my therapist/psych team are not really helping or being informative.",

I\u2019m not exactly sure what causes me to do this, but I pretty much feel like I\u2019m being squeezed to death in a small box if that makes sense. My family comforts me sometimes if I\u2019m really upset, but I just keep breaking down and crying to the point where it interferes with my daily life. They usually backtrack and blame it on how I never want to do anything with myself to be better, and it makes me feel like a huge ass failure. My mom in particular keeps calling me lazy, whiny, or any explicative you can think of. My mental health has been pretty good, but for the past few months I\u2019ve been stuck in a hole where I keep breaking off ties with my friends and school is draining. When I come home I binge on food, get angry because I feel sick, sleep, eat, sleep, school, repeat. I don\u2019t do any of my homework anymore, and I dropped from straight A\u2019s to B\u2019s and C\u2019s very quickly. I panic whenever I think about leaving the house. \n\nIn my mom\u2019s defence, though, I always complain about everything even if I don\u2019t intend to. My room is a mess, and I don\u2019t make any attempts to do any work in school or around my health. Am I just lazy?",

            "selftext": "I dont know how far I will elaborate on what I am going through but this oculd get a longer post. Please dont complain about some typos, its already late for me. Also English isnt my native language.  \n\n\nTo start everything off, my dad died around 2 1/2 years ago. At that time I was 13 years old, now im 16. We havent had the best relationship. It wasnt like that we had been in fights or something but he was ill, ill elaborate on this. He had Parkinson. My mom and him got divorced when I was 4 but it was all peacefully and without big problems, so when we moved away I saw him every 2 weeks at the weekend. My dad got lucky with my Mom since he was older. He already had 3 sons who could be my father. When he got me he was 67 years old. When I was around 10-12 his condition began to get bad and more bad. The first things to notice was seeing him shaking in his leg or arm. Then he began to not meet friends anymore and not even visit his sister which lived a 5 min walk away. I didnt think much about it because I thought it would be normal for a older person to be sleepy and all that stuff. But I didnt reflect the whole situation, which I still blame myself for today. After I told my mom I wanted to see my dad more often because I missed him \\~ around age 12 - 13, we moved to my hometown where my dad lived so I could see him more often. I did so but his condition only has gotten worse. He would be sleepy all the time and you could see that he wasnt himself anymore. Normally he always was wanted to look groomed and did everything for that but even that stopped. Because I couldnt do very much with him I played much with other kids and was out of house. He got care, so a worker would come by every morning. I dont know why, but I stopped talking to my dad pretty much,  although I was there much of my time. I still dont know till today why, maybe because I couldnt see my dad not well? i dont know. Well, one day he fell bad in the morning and broke his pelvis and went to hospital for operation. When I visited him, he was pretty good. We talked normal but I havent stayed for very long. When he went to rehab everything was fine at first but then we got a call that he had fallen again and his arm broke. After this, everything began to go downhill. He got into another hospital for a longer stay \\~ 4 weeks. When I went there with my brother (who lived in the same house as my dad with his kids) my dad was in a horribly bad shape. He was there like only physically, half asleep, not talking. I was so crushed honestly. When we went away again a hospital worker talked to us and said he would get into an old peoples home after his time in the hospital. I couldnt understand why but it was clear that my dad needed 24/7 care. At that point I didnt know my dad had Parkinson. I talked to my brother about it because my mom said she thinks my dad had Parkinson because of his symptoms. My brother said, yes, that some years ago the doctor would have diagnosed him with Parkinson, till today I dont understand why my Dad didnt talk to me about his illness, I could have helped him much better. When I visited him the next time with my mom, he luckily was in a better shape and able to talk again. But his Parkinson had gotten way further. His swallowing reflex was basically gone and it was a pain for him to eat because sometimes something would get into his trachea. When he got into the old peoples home, I visited him 3-4 times per week but I still didnt realize that his life was going to end. I thought that it would stay like this for some years. When my mom talked serious about it with me, i started to realize that my dad would die. In the next 4 weeks you could obviously see, that his conditon had gotten way more worse over time. When he was in his final state, he couldnt talk anymore, wasnt drinking or eating anything anymore. So we just sat there, talked with him about our day or what other funny things had happened in the past. The last 3 days were the hardest. There always was this fear of him finally going away, into heaven or where ever. When the final moment came I was in the room with my dad alone. He started breathing slower, I hold his hands and looked into his eyes. For the last time he was completely clear again. He opened his eyes further again and looked into my eyes and lost a tear, then he stopped breathing. I got my mom inside being overflowed in tears, it felt like i would lose my legs / the ground would be gone.   \n\n\nWell after his funeral my brothers got into a big argument about the heritage, 2 of them dont talk to each other till this day. I often went to his grave and wasnt sure about what to do now. My contact to the rest of my family (my father side of the family) has gotten way less since then, which i think is quite sad. The first 1 1/2 years after his death were pretty hard. Sometimes I was just a shell and even teachers described that I had gone from a happy person to a sad person. When I met new people from my grade I learned to live again, I have much joy when talking or hanging out with them till today. I often think about my dad and visit his grave. When im around people I am mostly having fun and not thinking about anything bad, but when im alone for some time and start to think about things, theres only my dad and how much it hurts to have losen him. To have lost the \"drive safe\" or \"i love you\" from my dad and i cry about it quite often. Then I have those phases like where im feeling fine for like 3-4 months and thinking about my dad is no problem, rather brings back the good moments with him. But then there are also the hard and bad phases in which I just wanna cry, lay around and do nothing, just sleep, I dont know. im not even sure if this is a depression but I feel like it since its part of my all day life all the time. Sometimes people ask if everythings ok and I just pass it off as sure, im fine. Even to my mom although I know I can talk to her about all this without any problems, but i mostly just rather keep it to myself.   \nMaybe some of you have gone through the same stuff, I would be happy to hear about how you people handle this \"phase\" thing or how you handled the death of a to you near standing person.  \n\n\nIm sorry for this much side information but I felt like it was needed a bit for explanation of my situation.",

Been on and off meds most of my life. \n\nI\u2019m a senior in college at the moment (early childhood education) and I\u2019ve been at an internship teaching children this semester on top on my regular classes. Some days I come home feeling good about my teaching, but most days I just beat myself up on the drive home. \n\nMy mentor gives me notes on how do, like things that went well and things that I could change. They\u2019re always heavy in praise but still stuff to improve on. I know this makes sense. I\u2019ve never worked with kids before this, all my experience up till now was theoretical or very limited. But when we read over and talk about my lesson I can\u2019t help but laser in on the bad. What did I fuck up? No matter that I did X great or she noticed me doing Y really well. I\u2019m too nervous to mention my feelings to her because for some reason I\u2019ve put her up on this pedestal and I want to make her proud. But when we talk it feels cold and unsupportive. Is that just me? Am I really losing my mind? Has all this effort been for nothing? What is going on? \n\nI\u2019m not sure that this placement is for me or maybe I\u2019m just wrong? Maybe I\u2019m at odds with my mentor? I feel like I need more emotional support honestly. I\u2019m still so lonely and I\u2019ve got nobody to vent to other than my therapist, and I\u2019m not seeing her enough probably. Nobody\u2019s fault there though. I still want to stop existing pretty constantly. It\u2019s just a dull ache now, not sharp anymore but it\u2019s still there. I need to try harder. Write more down. Stop fucking up. I want to make people proud of me but who? Why them? I want to talk with the other students in my class but I\u2019m the only man and I\u2019m about 6-7 years older, but I think I will tomorrow. I\u2019m really afraid to show how worried I am, how scared and alone I feel.",

I turn in little to none assignments and doze off in class. At this point I just wanna lock myself in my bedroom and hide forever. I just want support and I have to talk to my therapist tomorrow, but they're gonna bury me in questions, and I just wanna stay home but I've missed the limit. I don't wanna be alive and I know I'm overwhelmed and overreacting like usual, but can I get some support and some optimistic outlook?\n\nThank you.",

            "selftext": "Im new here, so to start i am an overweight 27 year old virgin male who has NEVER even kissed a girl. I have alot to get off my chest and i just wanted to put into writing instead of holding it in and maybe this will make me feel better IDK. Here goes nothing......\n\nThis pain inside is always there, no matter how much i try to keep my racing mind off of it. The feeling of loneliness isnt a feeling i would want for even my greatest enemy. For 27 years ive been so fucking lonely. I look around and i see these couples holding hands and being in love, and i stop to think why cant i find someone who can make me that happy. Inside this pain eats at me daily to the point where i just cry in the middle of the day. They say there is a person out there for everyone, well im ready to find my person damnit. I honestly don't even know if there is a person out there for me, i mean look at me. I hate looking in the mirror. I look absolutely disgusting, and if i think that im sure many others think worse and i wouldnt blame them. But i really do want love , i just think ill never find it. I dont want money or fame, just give me the love of my life and ill make due.\n\nIm laying here at 11:30 at night wondering if ill always be lonely, im starting to believe that i will. All day everday i dream about finding that one person and i think im harming myself when i do that because i know that person doesnt exist.im so tired of crying myself to sleep thinking that i will forever be lonely. Lately i just feel like im waiting and living just to die, believe me i dont want to feel like this but i do. Ive never been one to pray or even to believe in a god, but im am praying to god that he gives me a sign that there is a person out there for me. Im all cryed out and emotionally drained and i dont want to feel like this everyday.\n\nI am bitter,jealous,sad,emotional and i dont honestly know if i have the strength to continue. I don't know how to express how im I'm feeling to any of my family, im so ashamed of myself. I feel like if i did express my feelings i would feel better instead of holding it inside but im embarrassed of these feelings. I'm probably the most sad human being i know yet i have to somewhat be postive because i dont want anybody to know any of this. If by some miracle i do find love than all the tears, anger, sadness and regret will ALL vanish because then and only then will i finally be happy.\n\nCan I be him? I ask that EVERY TIME i see a happy couple together. I just want that so bad, ive NEVER experienced love before i just want to feel that feeling. Unfortunately i doubt i ever will, its sad and miserable feeling like this every day. Im rambling abit but you get the picture, im a sad miserable person who only wants love but i doubt i will ever found based off the fact that i am a ugly virgin who is afaird of his own shadow.\n\nIm afraid Ill never get to experience the wonderful feeling of love, and that really makes me sad and especially when that's all ive ever wanted on life.All of this may sound abit lame to most but i just had to get this off my chest, Hopefully one day hell freezes over one day and maybe just maybe a girl might just show interest in me.",

            "selftext": "So, I'm getting one of the most intensive psychiatric procedures you can (ECT). I still feel like shit. I'm lazy as fuck. I'm on sentence four (and they're pretty short) after about a half hour. I'm an adult, living with my Dad. My room is a fucking mess (filled with trash and old food). I needed to quit my job because of anxiety and depression. So I'm no longer able to pay him rent. Or pay for my phone. I don't really care about my family. I fantasize about raping one of my female \"friends\". Although I suppose the term \"acquaintances\" is closer to the truth (I don't really have friends). I've also photoshopped some pictures of her to be topless. Does that make me a shitty person? Of course. I think I feel like shit because I actually am. The world really would just be better off without me. \n\nECT doesn't help people stop being shitty people. That's probably why no anti-depressants have helped me either. Treatments for depression just help people who are actually depressed.",

She said she\u2019d still want to spend her life with me but she would be perfectly happy driving her car into incoming traffic. She refuses to consider inpatient care (I had a very bad inpatient experience as a teenager and I think she thinks hers would be that bad as well.) I know for a fact if I somehow got her admitted against her will that not only would that be the end of our marriage but most likely eventually of her life. I\u2019m so worried and afraid and so so sad for her.

I had a really bad phase recently and lied in bed for a couple of hours and couldn\u2019t stop crying. In this moment I just felt really worse. But after I got up and start to doing something to distract myself after maybe 30 minutes I couldn\u2019t feel that feeling I had then and I couldn\u2019t understand why I was so worse then too. It\u2019s like the emotion I had is blocked and my brain denied the access to it. If I ask myself how I was the last days there\u2019s only the state I\u2019m in right now. Logically I know that I was more worse two days ago but I can\u2019t compare it to my state of feeling right now. This really sucks because every time I\u2019m doing ok I get the feeling I maybe was always ok (and I was clearly not) and just making this whole thing up. Can someone relate?",

            "selftext": "This is gonna be really hard for me to type but I'm thankfully in sort of a better place right now. So, I'm an 18 year old guy, in grade 12, and since last semester, this beautiful girl, with green eyes has shown lots of interest in me, Naturally, at that time, I was busy with other stuff and mostly ignored her. Fast forward to this semester, she ended up being in one of my classes, and BOY OH BOY, I started to talk to her in class, and since that day, I have developed intense feelings for her. I should also add that I suffer from ADHD, BDD, OCD, BPD, so making an approach to her would be extremely hard, and now its at a point where my mind is not at ease at all, in fact, one time, just to get her attention, I randomly started to lightly self harm (Not cutting skin thankfully) but just poking my arm hard with a pencil, she started to notice when I started to talk about my life to my friend, and all the pain I had been feeling because of the disconnect between me and her, and the week after, where I was tired of how I could never get the chance to be with her, or talk to her, I felt this intense emotional pain, I couldn't stop crying, got urges to shave my head, to harm myself, because I have never been loved by any girl, never been hugged, never been kissed, never been missed by one! so it took a ENORMOUS toll on my mental health. Thankfully, the day later, she engaged conversation! and we talked about our interests, and she invited me over somewhere at lunch! Naturally, the depression, the emotional pain, instantly went away when this happened, and after the Easter weekend, I was very happy, very excited, I was SURE that something would happen, but... she ended up ignoring me completely, acting like a different person. After this occurred, I could describe my soul, and my mind, crashing down, what had I done? Why was she acting like this now? Why didn't she say hi? I went home, cried hard in the washroom in the fetal position, was also starting to get these intense urges to do Xanax and energy drinks to make me \"escape\" the immense emotional pain I felt, I cried at least 3 times, my heart and chest literally hurting from it, my legs hurting, the thoughts of her being with someone, moving on, and leaving me to cry and be in pain on the floor after high school ended. My little brother, was negatively affected as well, my mom said that he was in tears for me, he hated me being in such emotional pain, and this made me even more sad. Today, I talked to my counsler about this pain, that wouldn't go away, and spilled the beans on everything with her, the anger and depression, the physical and emotional pain, the urges, and she had no other choice but to call a suicide hotline. I chatted with the lady, and offered me to talk to off duty officers and psychiatrists about my experience and the thoughts that I feel. I personally feel like I have hit a dead end, my friends aren't able to help me, my siblings aren't able to help me, and my own thoughts cant help me, I have decided that tomorrow or day after tomorrow is gonna be my one final chance to do something about her, if not, that I have to move on, and feel this pain for months and months, what should I do!? Talk to her!? I just dont know how to get this emotional pain and depression away from me, anyone, SOMEONE, just help! I cant take it anymore, its eating me up alive, its hurting my friends, me, and my family, I just someone to tell me what to do, this is one of the hardest points of my life as of now, what do you suggest I do??",

            "selftext": "Hi, so I\u2019m not diagnosed or anything but I would like some advice that would be great. The past few months if felt numb. I feel like I can only feel about 10% of emotions, so I can feel sad but it\u2019s only slightly sad despite harsh circumstances etc. I\u2019m not content but I\u2019m not sad either I\u2019m on this weird middle ground. It feels like if a cup was a brain, the water inside was emotions and when you pour the water out you feel the emotion. But it feels like someone has their hand over the upside down glass so I\u2019m only feeling a little bit of the emotion that\u2019s leaked through the hand. That\u2019s how my head feels. It literally feels like something is blocked in my head that only lets a slight bit of emotion through. Is this depression or am I just messed up?\n\nI also used to get REALLY anxious and for the first like 2 months of my job I wouldn\u2019t eat a thing and vomited every single day multiple times out of how anxious I was. But not I can\u2019t feel that anymore. It\u2019s making me be a bit wreck less because I can\u2019t fear the outcome of the bad stuff I\u2019m doing. \n\nIf anyone knows what this is please tell me. I want to go see a doctor but the ones in my area are VERY condescending and I feel like doctors are judgy about mental health.",

Since my elementary years according to my mother but with her help I've started anti depressants after my job with her noticing my suicidal tendencies. \n\nThings got ok after that. I found a new job with better pay and became more open during that job and more happy i guess. Needless to say it didn't stay that way and I quit after having a seizure and condoning brain surgery. I shouldn't have quit. The insurance would've made the doctors happy I'm sure but my sertraline had run out and I was bedridden not knowing what to do. I'm guessing the sudden unexpected situation made my depression worse or smth. So I got my job back somehow (guessing they felt bad for me or just desperately needed workers) and things became better again.\n\nBut of course I fuscked that up again by getting too ahead of myself going to college.\n\nQuitting my job and it's insurance bs premiums, with enough saved up in my pocket not a month later I wake again in an ambulance. I just finished paying off the first one wtf\n\nThey gave me some dilantin and another rom the first check up keppra or whatever tf. My body has this weird tingly feeling like I'm made of goo or something everytime I move muscles or eyes move it feels weird. I might od on all the dumbass drs prescribed me. Finals are in two weeks and I dont know if i can even handle school anymore. I'm tired of being this lame excuse of an adult anyways. all they care about is money anyways. they can have itif they want it",

When I act all weird in front of my friends they think I'm retarded, but today I finally worked up enough courage to tell one of my friends how shitty I feel.  I really don't want to go to a therapist because my parents would see me as weak, especially my dad.  I really want to get help but I don't want to.  It just pains me because this has been going on since September 2018.  On top of that I have ADHD and ODD.  I just found out that this subreddit exists, so I hope I can get some help from others who can help.  I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few months now and I used to bash myself on the head with glass or a metal bat.  Again, I really want help but I am too afraid it will ruin how people see me.  The worst fucking part is I'm not even old yet.  Im a fucking 14 year old.  I don't see any reason that anyone really will care.  My grades have been dropping, and I just don't know.  It hurts me just to write this.  My parents don't even know and I don't want to cry about it.  When I see others and how happy they are, when I get home I just cry.",

I didnt really understand death, and for a while i thought that by thinking hard enough i could brig her back. GUESS WHAT it didnt work. then i talked to my mom, and she told me that stella couldnt come back, and I was mad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really wanted to see her so I came up with possibly the stupidest suicide plan EVER. I would go out to the snow (I live in a place that gets really cold and snowy in the winter), without a jacket, or snowpants, or hoodie, or pants, or really, anything. And then I would freeze to death, and see stella again, because who would miss a skinny little 6 year old?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwell as i was about to run outside my dad saw me running tward the door, and he stopped me from going out. I really doubt that i would have died, but i still think it is funny and stupid.",

I'll explain to her how I've been in a functional depression for 5+ years and now a severe depression. This ain't my first rodeo, and I'm sooooo tired of trying new meds. I'm not judging anyone, but for me personally, I've always hated medication. I do not like to be reliant on it and don't want to worry about side effects. I've changed meds several times and never really notice much of a difference, so to me it seems like the pills don't really work anyway. It just seems to be based on circumstances in my life. When things are going relatively well, I do fine, and the meds \"work.\" When things are horrible in my life, I struggle with mental illness and the meds \"don't work.\" Surely that can't be a coincidence. Anyone else been in that situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'll tell my PCP that and then ask for a referral for a psych outpatient evaluation before then finding a psychiatrist. Anything else I should mention or do? Thanks.",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: I have an amazing boyfriend, a dream job, and am super close to my family. Why do I cry all the time?\n\nI  never considered myself to be a crier and have many lifelong friends who have never seen me cry. For the past 7 months or so I have had such a hard time not crying even over the smallest things. I graduated college in May 2018 and cried a normal amount because of stress in school but nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe I just miss my college life and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so upset but it\u2019s been almost a full year. I also met my boyfriend in May and he is so wonderful to me. He would never do anything to hurt me and if I ever complain to him about something he is super apologetic and makes sure to fix it. He is always concerned about how I am feeling and is very understanding of all my stress and anxiety. He also works a night shift so I only get to see him a few late nights a week and maybe one full day. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the problem but maybe my emotions are more extreme because of being in my first relationship? I also live alone which I think may be impacting how I\u2019m feeling. I always go have dinner with my parents so I\u2019m not totally alone every night but when I get home and I\u2019m alone late at night it\u2019s hard. \n\nThe smallest things make me cry. Something goes not as planned at work? I have to focus on not crying. Someone says the smallest comment that I don\u2019t like? I cry. My boyfriend interrupts me? I cry. He makes a joke? I cry. It\u2019s always upset crying and never happy crying. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should see a therapist or get a pet to have as company or what. I\u2019ve never felt like this before and it\u2019s been wearing me down for at least the last 7 months.",

I had terrible anxiety and would have panic attacks about every day before college. I had never really had a problem with anxiety before but I ended up getting a job as a cashier and the 30 second interactions really helped me with that. Once my anxiety got a little better my depression started to fade away. It's been about two years now and I'm not going to say everything's perfect, I still have some bad days but not like before. I feel really proud of the progress I made, it took way too long to get here but I'm glad I made it.",
